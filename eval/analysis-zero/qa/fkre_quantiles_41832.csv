614,614,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""commission on catastrophic disaster risk and insurance act of 2006"". sec. 2. findings. congress finds the following: (1) hurricanes katrina, rita, and wilma, which struck the united states in 2005, caused over $200 billion in total economic losses, including insured and uninsured losses. (2) although private sector insurance is currently available to spread some catastrophe-related losses throughout the nation and internationally, most experts believe there will be significant insurance and reinsurance shortages, resulting in dramatic rate increases for consumers and businesses, and the unavailability of catastrophe insurance. (3) the federal government has provided and will continue to provide billions of dollars and resources to pay for losses from catastrophes, including hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, tornados, and other disasters, at huge costs to american taxpayers. (4) the federal government has a critical interest in ensuring appropriate and fiscally responsible risk management of catastrophes. mortgages require reliable property insurance, and the unavailability of reliable property insurance would make most real estate transactions impossible. in addition, the public health, safety, and welfare demand that structures damaged or destroyed in a catastrophe be reconstructed as soon as possible. therefore, the inability of the private sector insurance and reinsurance markets to maintain sufficient capacity to enable americans to obtain property insurance coverage in the private sector endangers the national economy and the public health, safety, and welfare. (5) multiple proposals have been introduced in the united states congress over the past decade to address catastrophic risk insurance, including the creation of a national catastrophic reinsurance fund and the revision of the federal tax code to allow insurers to use tax-deferred catastrophe funds, yet congress has failed to act on any of these proposals. (6) to the extent the united states faces high risks from catastrophe exposure, essential technical information on financial structures and innovations in the catastrophe insurance market is needed. (7) the most efficient and effective approach to assessing the catastrophe insurance problem in the public policy context is to establish a bipartisan commission of experts to study the management of catastrophic disaster risk, and to require such commission to timely report its recommendations to congress so that congress can quickly craft a solution to protect the american people. sec. 3. establishment. there is established a bipartisan commission on catastrophic disaster risk and insurance (in this act referred to as the ""commission""). sec. 4. membership. (a) members. --the commission shall be composed of the following: (1) the director of the federal emergency management agency or a designee of the director. (2) the administrator of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration or a designee of the administrator. (3) 12 additional members or their designees of whom one shall be-- (a) a representative of a consumer group; (b) a representative of a primary insurance company; (c) a representative of a reinsurance company; (d) an independent insurance agent with experience in writing property and casualty insurance policies; (e) a state insurance regulator; (f) a state emergency operations official; (g) a scientist; (h) a faculty member of an accredited university with experience in risk management; (i) a member of nationally recognized think tank with experience in risk management; (j) a homebuilder with experience in structural engineering; (k) a mortgage lender; and (l) a nationally recognized expert in antitrust law.

(2) since 1978 the number of certified large air carriers has decreased from 30 to 10. in 1998, 6 of the united states' largest air carriers sought to enter into arrangements that would result in 3 large networks comprising approximately 70 percent of the domestic market. (3) only \\\\2/3\\\\ of all communities in the united states that had scheduled air service in 1978 still have it today, and \\\\1/ 2\\\\ of those remaining are served by smaller airlines feeding hub airports. (4) the department of transportation's domestic airline fares consumer report for the 3rd quarter of 1997 listed 75 major city pairs where fares increased by 30 percent or more year-over-year, while total traffic in these city pairs decreased by 863,500 passengers, or more than 20 percent. (5) a 1998 department of transportation study found that large united states air carriers charge twice as much at their large hub airports where there is no low fare competition as they charge at a hub airport where a low fare competitor is present. the general accounting office found that fares range from 12 percent to 71 percent higher at hubs dominated by one carrier or a consortium. (6) complaints filed with the department of transportation about airline travel have increased by more than 25 percent over the previous year, and complaints against large united states air carriers have increased from 6,394 in 1997 to 7,994 in 1998. (7) the 1997 national civil aviation review commission reported that recent data indicate the problem of delay in flights is getting worse, and that the number of daily aircraft delays of 15 minutes or longer was nearly 20 percent higher in 1996 than in 1995. (8) the 1997 national civil aviation review commission forecast that united states domestic and international passenger enplanements are expected to increase 52 percent between 1996 and 2006, and the federal aviation administration forecasts annual growth in revenue passenger miles will average 4.2 percent. (9) a 1998 department of transportation study found that the large united states air carriers charge about 60 percent more to passengers traveling to or from small communities than they charge to passengers traveling between large communities.

(2) applicants for temporary admission as nonimmigrants, such as tourists and foreign students, are required to disclose their hiv status when applying for a visa. if questioned, such applicants may be required to undergo an hiv test. (3) the secretary of homeland security may issue a waiver to the hiv prohibition, on a case-by-case basis, only to any hiv-positive individual who-- (a) (i) applies for permanent admission as an immigrant; (ii) is the parent, spouse, unmarried son or daughter, or minor adopted child of a united states citizen or a permanent resident, or a refugee or asylee adjusting to immigrant status; and (iii) can establish that-- (i) the danger to the public health of the united states created by the applicant's admission would be minimal; (ii) the possibility of the spread of the infection created by the applicant's admission would be minimal; and (iii) there would be no cost incurred by any level of government agency of the united states without the prior consent of that agency; (b) (i) applies for admission as a refugee; (ii) is eligible for admission for humanitarian purposes or to assure family unity, or whose admission is otherwise in the public interest; and (iii) meets the requirements described in subclauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (a) (iii); or (c) applies for a short-term nonimmigrant visa, including-- (i) a tourist who meets the requirements described in subclauses (i) through (iii) of subparagraph (a) (iii) and intends to remain in the united states for less than 30 days; and (ii) a participant in a designated event, such as a conference or international sporting event and intends to remain in the united states for less than 10 days. (4) the travel and immigration ban on hiv-positive individuals-- (a) was implemented in 1987 by regulations issued through the public health service of the department of health and human services; and (b) requires hiv screening for all persons over 14 years of age who apply for an immigrant or nonimmigrant visa. (5) section 212 (a)(1) (a) (i) of the immigration and nationality act (8 u.s.c. 1182 (a)(1) (a) (i)) authorizes the secretary of health and human services to prescribe regulations to determine which diseases are considered ""communicable diseases of public health significance"" that would exclude noncitizens with such diseases from entering the united states. (6) in 1991, the secretary of health and human services, after conducting a public health analysis, proposed ending the hiv travel and immigration ban by removing hiv from the list of communicable diseases of public health significance. the proposal was eventually dropped due to opposition from the congress. (7) in 1993, congress revoked the authority of the secretary of health and human services to make a public health determination regarding hiv status as grounds for inadmissibility for potential foreign students, tourists, refugees, and immigrants to the united states by specifically designating ""infection with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome"" as a communicable disease of public health significance under section 212 (a)(1) (a) (i) of the immigration and nationality act. (8) the united states is 1 of 13 countries with a law that bans travel and immigration for persons with hiv. the other countries are armenia, brunei, china, iraq, qatar, south korea, libya, moldova, oman, the russian federation, saudi arabia, and sudan. (9) the hiv travel and immigration ban impacts thousands of prospective hiv-positive foreign students, tourists, refugees and immigrants who may be denied entry into the united states due solely to their hiv status. (10) the hiv travel and immigration ban may discourage some foreign students, refugees, and nonpermanent residents who are in the united states and who may be at risk of infection from seeking testing, treatment, or care for hiv/aids. (11) the united nations, the joint united nations programme on hiv/aids (unaids), and the world health organization oppose any restrictions on travel and immigration for people living with hiv/aids. the 2006 consolidated version of the united nation's international guidelines on hiv/aids and human rights, produced jointly by the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights and unaids, states ""there is no public health rationale for restricting liberty of movement or choice of residence on the grounds of hiv status. according to current international health regulations, the only disease which requires a certificate for international travel is yellow fever. therefore, any restrictions on these rights based on suspected or real hiv status alone, including hiv screening of international travellers, are discriminatory and cannot be justified by public health concerns. . . . where states prohibit people living with hiv from longer-term residency due to concerns about economic costs, states should not single out hiv/aids, as opposed to comparable conditions, for such treatment and should establish that such costs would indeed be incurred in the case of the individual alien seeking residency. in considering entry applications, humanitarian concerns, such as family reunification and the need for asylum, should outweigh economic considerations. "". (12) on world aids day, december 1, 2006, the president proposed streamlining the current waiver process for hiv- positive individuals seeking to enter the united states on short-term business or tourist visas for up to 60 days by granting them a categorical waiver. if implemented, the president's proposal would only affect the waiver process for short-term visitors, and would not affect hiv-positive individuals seeking permanent residence or nontourist visas. (13) there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that the hiv travel and immigration ban is an effective way to prevent the spread of hiv or that it provides any economic benefit by reducing costs to the public health care system. sec. 3. amendment to the immigration and nationality act. section 212 (a)(1) (a) of the immigration and nationality act (8 u.s.c. 1182 (a)(1) (a)) is amended-- (1) in clause (i), by striking ""which shall include infection with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome,""; and (2) by striking ""is inadmissibility"" and inserting ""is inadmissible"". sec. 4. review of travel and immigration regulations regarding hiv.

(a) findings. --congress makes the following findings: (1) the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities near residential communities and facilities such as schools can greatly reduce the value of residential properties, destroy the views from properties, produce radio frequency interference, raise concerns about potential long-term health effects of such facilities, and reduce substantially the desire to live in the areas of such facilities. (2) states and local governments have traditionally regulated development and should be able to exercise control over the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities through the use of zoning and other land use regulations relating to the protection of the environment, public health and safety, and the general welfare of the community and the public. (3) the federal communications commission establishes policies to govern interstate and international communications by television, radio, wire, satellite, and cable. the commission ensures compliance of such activities with applicable federal laws, including the national environmental policy act of 1969 and the national historic preservation act, in its decision-making on such activities. (4) the commission defers to state and local authorities which regulate the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities through the use of zoning, construction and building, and environmental and safety regulations in order to protect the environment and the health, safety, and general welfare of communities and the public. (5) on august 19, 1997, the commission issued a proposed rule, mm docket no. 97-182, which would preempt the application of most state and local zoning, environmental, construction and building, and other regulations affecting the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities.
