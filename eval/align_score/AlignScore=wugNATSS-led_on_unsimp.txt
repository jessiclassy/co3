Findings.--Congress finds and declares that-- it is in the national interest that the public lands are producing and continue to produce water and soil conservation benefits, livestock forage, wildlife forage and recreation and other multiple use opportunities; rangelands will continue to be stabilized and improved long term by providing for cooperative agreements, private, public partnerships and flexibility in management programs and agreements; to assure sound management and stewardship of the renewable resources it is imperative to charge a fee that is reasonable and equitable and represents the fair value of the forage provided; the intermingled private-public land ownership patterns prevailing in much of the west create a strong interdependence between public and private lands for forage, water, and habitat for both wildlife and livestock; the social and economic infrastructure of many rural communities and stability of job opportunities in many areas of rural America are highly independent on the protection of the value of privately held production units on Federal lands. Unless contrary to this statute, all grazing operations conducted on any Federal lands shall be subject to all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, including but not limited to: Animal Damage Control Act (7 U.S.C. 426-426b).

For each year after the first year that the Secretaries calculate the Federal forage fee, the fee shall not be greater than 125 percent, or less than 75 percent of the Federal forage fee calculated for the previous year. The survey of nonfee costs used to calculate the nonfee cost differential shall be updated periodically by the Secretaries so as to reflect as accurately as possible the actual nonfee costs incurred by the cattle and sheep industry that utilizes public lands in the sixteen Western States.

<ROW>2</ROW><BILL>"This Act may be cited as the ``Merchant Marine of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act''. The Congress finds the following: 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the Allied victory in World War II and the restoration of peacetime across the European and Pacific theaters. The United States Merchant Marine was integral in providing the link between domestic production and the fighting forces overseas, providing combat equipment, fuel, food, commodities, and raw materials to troops stationed overseas. Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowledged the indispensability of the Merchant Marine to the victory in a 1945 letter stating that without their support, ``the Navy could not have accomplished its mission''. President and former Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, Dwight D. Eisenhower, acknowledged that ``through the prompt delivery of supplies and equipment to our armed forces overseas, and of cargoes representing economic and military aid to friendly nations, the American Merchant Marine has effectively helped to strengthen the forces of freedom throughout the world''. Military missions and war planning were contingent upon the availability of resources and that the United States Merchant Marine played a vital role in this regard, ensuring the efficient and reliable transoceanic transport of military equipment as well as both military and civilian personnel. The United States Merchant Marine provided for the successful transport of resources and personnel despite consistent and ongoing exposure to enemy combatants from both the air and the sea, such as enemy bomber squadrons, submarines, and mines. The efforts of the United States Merchant Marine were not without sacrifices as they bore a higher per capita casualty rate than any other branch of the military during the war. The United States Merchant Marine proved to be an instrumental asset on untold occasions, participating in every landing operation by the United States Marine Corps from Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima as well as providing, for instance, the bulk tonnage of material necessary for the invasion of Normandy which ``would not have been possible without the Merchant Marine'', as a 1944 New York Times article observed. In also assessing their performance, General Dwight D. Eisenhower stated, ``every man in this Allied command is quick to express his admiration for the loyalty, courage, and fortitude of the officers and men of the Merchant Marine. We count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion to duty as we do our own; they have never failed us''. During a September 1944 speech, President Franklin D. Roosevelt stated, the Merchant Marine has ``delivered the goods when and where needed in every theater of operations and across every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult, and dangerous transportation job ever undertaken. As time goes on, there will be greater public understanding of our merchant fleet's record during this war.''. The feats and accomplishments of the Merchant Marine are deserving of broader public recognition. The United States will be forever grateful and indebted to the U.S. Merchant Marine for their effective, reliable, and courageous transport of goods and resources in enemy territory throughout theaters of every variety in World War II; that these goods and resources saved thousands of lives and enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory in World War II. The Congressional Gold Medal will be an appropriate way to shed further light on the service of the Merchant Marine in World War II and the instrumental role they played in winning World War II. Award Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate arrangements for the award, on behalf of the Congress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design to the U.S. Merchant Marine of World War II, in recognition of their dedicated and vital service during World War II. Design and Striking.--For the purposes of the award referred to in subsection , the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall strike the gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary. American Merchant Marine Museum.-- In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in honor of the U.S. Merchant Marine, the gold medal shall be given to the American Merchant Marine Museum, where it will be available for display as appropriate and available for research. Under such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, the Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal struck under section 3, at a price sufficient to cover the costs of the medals, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses.

Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5134 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.

<ROW>14</ROW><BILL>"This Act may be cited as the ``Mercury Health Advisory Act of 2003''. Findings.--Congress makes the following findings: Mercury is a persistent, bioaccumulative heavy metal that poses a significant risk to human health, wildlife, and the environment. Mercury discharges into the atmosphere and surface oceans have increased two-to-five fold since the beginning of the industrialized period due to human activities. Substantial evidence is accumulating that exposure to methyl-mercury is widespread in the general public and occurring at higher than health-based levels of concern according to the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the World Health Organization. Fish and seafood caught or sold in the United States are contaminated with methyl-mercury, a toxic element that may cause neurological damage and other health-related problems as a result of fish or seafood consumption. According to the 1997 Environmental Protection Agency Mercury Report to Congress, mercury levels in the following fish, at least occasionally, exceeded the Food and Drug Administration's ``action level'' limit of 1 part per million: tilefish, king mackerel, shark, swordfish, tuna, lobster, red snapper, saltwater and freshwater bass, bluefish, bluegills, catfish, crappie, groupers, hake, halibut, northern pike, walleye, largemouth bass, pompano, snook, sunfish, and other finfish. The Food and Drug Administration advises pregnant women and women of childbearing age not to eat shark, king mackerel, tilefish, and swordfish and to limit consumption of all other fish to 12 ounces per week. The Food and Drug Administration advises other persons to limit their consumption of shark and swordfish to no more than 7 ounces per week. The Environmental Protection Agency recommends that women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant, nursing mothers, and young children limit fish consumption to 6 meals per week of cooked fish or an 8-ounce meal per week for uncooked fish for adults and 2 meals per week of cooked fish or a 3-ounce meal per week of uncooked fish for young children. In 2003, 44 States issued health advisories that warned the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared to 27 States that issued such advisories in 1993. Eleven States warn pregnant women and young children to limit consumption of canned tuna, the most consumed fish in the United States, to 1 or 2 cans per week and some States warn that the ``white'' albacore canned tuna has significantly higher mercury levels than the ``light'' tuna, based upon Food and Drug Administration testing. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Centers indicates that 7.8 percent of women of childbearing age have blood mercury levels in their bodies above what is considered safe for the developing fetus, translating into over 300,000 babies born each year in the United States at risk of mercury poisoning. Between 30 percent and 50 percent of women of childbearing age are not aware of the methyl-mercury exposure risks from ingestion of mercury-contaminated fish, according to the Food and Drug Administration. A January 2001 report by the United States General Accounting Office criticized the Food and Drug Administration for not providing guidance to the fishing industry to identify and prevent fish contaminated with mercury from reaching consumers, even though the Agency's own testing found that, for example, over half of the swordfish exceeded its action level of one part per million . Evidence is continuing to emerge linking increased risk of coronary heart disease to mercury exposure, as presented in at least 2 peer reviewed studies. Health advisory information on mercury-contaminated fish, which is necessary to protect public health, is not widely known by the State or Federal Government. This lack of awareness potentially threatens tens of millions of Americans who may unknowingly ingest harmful amounts of mercury because they are not aware of exposure risks from consumption of freshwater fish and seafood. Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to-- ensure that the public is adequately informed about the potential adverse effects of mercury exposure through the consumption of fish products; require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to work cooperatively with other Federal and State agencies, as well as nonprofit organizations, to create appropriate advisories for the distribution to the public of explanations of the potential adverse effects of mercury exposure from fish consumption; require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to work cooperatively with State fish and game officials to create an informative guide for distribution to the public about the dangers of the consumption of recreationally-caught fish; require the Food and Drug Administration to resume its seafood methyl-mercury monitoring program to better document mercury levels in various fish species sold in commerce; require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in cooperation with private and public organizations, to design and implement a National Public Education Program regarding the presence of methyl-mercury in seafood and fish consumption advisories for methyl-mercury; and require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to annually prepare a report on the impacts of mercury on human health and the environment. In this Act: Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Commissioner.--The term ``Commissioner'' means the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. Health professional.--The term ``health professional'' means any licensed professional in the dental and medical profession. Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Criteria.--The advisories developed under this subsection shall-- explain, in an easily understandable manner, the dangers of mercury exposure through the consumption of mercury contaminated fish to women of childbearing age, women who expect to become pregnant, women who are pregnant or breast feeding their children, and young children and their parents; describe, in an easily understandable manner, in detail the most current mercury health advisories prepared by the Federal Government concerning fish consumption, contain the toll free number established under paragraph , and contain such other information as the Secretary determines appropriate; and be printed in large type in English, Spanish, and other languages determined by the Secretary to be culturally and linguistically appropriate. Toll-free telephone number.--The Secretary shall establish a toll-free telephone number to enable individuals to obtain additional information about the health advisories developed under this subsection concerning exposure to mercury from consumption of fish and seafood, as well as exposure from other sources. Updating of information.--The information provided under this subsection shall be updated periodically as determined necessary by the Secretary. Mercury Warning Consumer's Guide.-- In general.--The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary, shall prepare a consumer's guide to mercury and health advisory for the consumption of recreationally-caught fish. Such guide shall be distributed, at no cost, to-- State departments of fisheries, wildlife, and environmental law enforcement; all applicants for a fishing license at the time the license is issued; and to public upon request. Criteria.--The guide developed under paragraph shall-- be printed in large type in English, Spanish, and other languages determined by the Secretary to be culturally and linguistically appropriate; contain the toll free telephone number established by the Environmental Protection Agency that residents may call for further information about the health advisories contained in the guide. Updating of information.--The guide developed under paragraph shall be updated periodically as determined necessary by the Secretary. Consumption Advisory.-- In general.--The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator, shall work with the States and other appropriate entities to-- develop and distribute regional and national advisories concerning the presence of methyl-mercury in seafood; develop standardized formats for written and broadcast advisories regarding methyl-mercury in seafood; develop and periodically upgrade information related to mercury fish tissue test results and fish consumption advisories for methyl-mercury; coordinate State and local advisories in the formation of the National Public Education Program under subsection ; and coordinate with that sector of the retail food industry that is engaged in the sale of any fresh, packaged, or frozen fish or seafood products intended for human consumption, concerning the posting of such advisories in their place of business where fish are sold to inform women of childbearing age, pregnant, and nursing women and the parents of young children on the potential dangers of mercury that is present in certain fish or seafood. Criteria.--The advisories and notices developed under paragraph shall include information both on limiting the consumption of certain high level fish and seafood to the general population and, for sensitive populations such as women of childbearing age and children, stress the importance of limiting consumption of frequently consumed fish that may exceed the Environmental Protection Agency's Reference Dose. Consumption advisory.-- In general.--Based on information compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Marine Fisheries Services, and the Food and Drug Administration, shall work with State health, fish and wildlife, and environmental agencies to develop and periodically update a consumption advisory for any fresh, packaged, or frozen fish or seafood products intended for human consumption for posting by retail food establishments and restaurants pursuant to this Act. The advisory shall provide information about the potential dangers from the ingestion of mercury from the consumption of fish and seafood by women of childbearing age, pregnant women, and young children and other at-risk groups as determined by the Department, including populations consuming above- average quantities of fish and seafood. Distribution.--The Secretary shall make copies of the advisory developed under subparagraph available to State boards of health or other State and local governmental entities that have the same authority as a State board of health for distribution to the public and to local retail food establishments and restaurants. Requirements.--The advisories and notices developed under this subsection shall be printed in large type in English, Spanish, and other languages determined by the Secretary to be culturally and linguistically appropriate. Public Education and Advisory System.-- Public education.--The Secretary, in consultation with public and nonprofit private entities (including cooperative extension services and appropriate State entities), shall design and implement a national public education program regarding the presence of methyl-mercury in seafood. Features.--The program developed under paragraph shall provide-- information to the public regarding-- Federal standards and good practice requirements relating to methyl-mercury in seafood; and the promotion of public awareness, understanding, and acceptance of such standards and requirements; information to health professionals so that health professionals may improve the diagnosis and treatment of mercury-related illness and advise individuals whose health conditions place those individuals at particular risk; and such other information or advice to consumers and other individuals as the Secretary determines will promote the purposes of this section. Sampling and Monitoring.-- In general.--The Commissioner shall resume the seafood methyl-mercury monitoring sampling program of the Food and Drug Administration to assist in documenting mercury levels in various fish species. Monitoring.--The sampling program described in paragraph shall be conducted so as to provide statistically valid monitoring data with respect to mercury levels in fish and seafood (including market-basket studies) including documenting the extent to which fish with mercury levels in excess of the action level are sold in commerce. Such information, along with information gathered by the Environmental Protection Agency, shall be compiled into an annual report by the Commissioner to track changes in dietary exposure to mercury from fish and seafood. Avoidance of duplication of effort.--To the extent practicable, the sampling program described in paragraph shall be consistent with, and shall be coordinated with, other seafood sampling programs that are in use, so as to avoid duplication of effort.

Objectives for E&M Guidelines.--The objectives for E&M guidelines specified in this subsection are as follows (relative to the E&M guidelines and review policies in effect as of the date of the enactment of this Act): Enhancing clinically relevant documentation needed to accurately code and assess coding levels accurately. Reducing administrative burdens. Decreasing the level of non-clinically pertinent and burdensome documentation time and content in the record. Increased accuracy by carrier reviewers.

The notice should include suggestions to the physician on how the billing problem may be remedied. Repayment of Overpayments Without Penalty.--The Secretary shall permit physicians to repay medicare overpayments within 3 months without penalty or interest and without threat of denial of other claims based upon extrapolation.

<ROW>21</ROW><BILL>"This Act may be cited as the ``Reduce Expenditures in Nuclear Infrastructure Now Act'' or the ``REIN-IN Act''. Congress finds the following: The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Soviet Union no longer exists, and the Cold War is over. The nature of threats to the national security and military interests of the United States has changed. However, the United States continues to maintain an enormous arsenal of nuclear weapons and delivery systems that were devised with the Cold War in mind. The current nuclear arsenal of the United States includes approximately 5,000 total nuclear warheads, of which approximately 2,000 are deployed with three delivery components: long-range strategic bomber aircraft, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The bomber fleet of the United States comprises 93 B-52 and 20 B-2 aircraft. The United States maintains 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The United States also maintains 14 Ohio-class submarines, up to 12 of which are deployed at sea. Each of those submarines is armed with up to 96 independently targetable nuclear warheads. This Cold War-based approach to nuclear security comes at significant cost. Over the next 10 years, the United States will spend hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining and upgrading its nuclear force, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A substantial decrease in spending on the nuclear arsenal of the United States is prudent for both the budget and national security. The national security interests of the United States can be well served by reducing the total number of deployed nuclear warheads and their delivery systems, as stated by the Department of Defense's June 2013 nuclear policy guidance entitled, ``Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy of the United States''. This guidance found that force levels under the Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed on April 8, 2010, and entered into force on February 5, 2011, between the United States and the Russian Federation (commonly known as the ``New START Treaty'') ``are more than adequate for what the United States needs to fulfill its national security objectives'' and that the force can be reduced by up to \1/3\ below levels under the New START Treaty to 1,000 to 1,100 warheads. Even without additional reductions in deployed strategic warheads, the United States can save tens of billions of dollars by deploying those warheads more efficiently on delivery systems and by deferring production of new delivery systems until they are needed. Economic security and national security are linked and both will be well served by smart defense spending. Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated on June 24, 2010, ``Our national debt is our biggest national security threat'' and on August 2, 2011, stated, ``I haven't changed my view that the continually increasing debt is the biggest threat we have to our national security.''. The Government Accountability Office has found that there is significant waste in the construction of the nuclear facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration of the Department of Energy.

<ROW>25</ROW><BILL>"This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Afghanistan Status of Forces Agreement Act of 2011''. Congress finds the following: Al Qaeda, a terrorist organization using Afghanistan as a base of operations, attacked the United States on September 11, 2001, killing nearly 3,000 people in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Congress passed and the President signed the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) on September 18, 2001. The United States initiated Operation Enduring Freedom to combat Al Qaeda and prevent the Taliban regime in Afghanistan from providing Al Qaeda with safe harbor. The Taliban was removed from power and the United States concluded security agreements with the newly formed Afghan government. Al Qaeda no longer has a major or relevant presence in Afghanistan. The United States and Afghanistan has exchanged notes, signed agreements, and issued ``joint declarations'' on various topics, but have not entered into a bilateral agreement on the status of forces. A status of forces agreement with Afghanistan would not expressly authorize the United States to carry out military operations in Afghanistan but would recognize that such operations are ongoing. The United States is currently party to more than 100 agreements on the status of forces. A status of forces agreement may be a multilateral or bilateral agreement addressing the status of United States Armed Forces while present in a foreign country. Status of forces agreements may include--but are not limited to--how the domestic laws of the foreign jurisdiction shall be applied to United States personnel and contractors while in that country. In a similar agreement, parties have pledged to work cooperatively in a number of fields, including on diplomatic, security, economic, cultural, and law enforcement matters. In a similar agreement, a deadline has been established for the withdrawal of United States troops by a date certain. United States personnel subject to a status of forces agreement may include members of the United States Armed Forces, Department of Defense civilian employees, and contractors working for the Department of Defense. In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall seek to negotiate and enter into a bilateral status of forces agreement with the Government of Afghanistan in accordance with the requirements of this section. Mandatory Elements.--The status of forces agreement specified in subsection shall, to the maximum extent practicable-- prohibit the permanent basing or military presence of United States Armed Forces in Afghanistan; provide a date, no later than 1 year after the date on which the agreement is entered into with the Government of Afghanistan, for the complete, safe, and orderly redeployment from Afghanistan of all members of the United States Armed Forces, Department of Defense civilian employees, and contractors working for the Department of Defense; and establish that the temporary presence of United States Armed Forces in Afghanistan is at the request and invitation of the sovereign Government of Afghanistan. Discretionary Elements.--The status of forces agreement specified in subsection may provide for the authorization of specific exercises, activities, or missions of the United States Armed Forces in Afghanistan. Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the President should submit the status of forces agreement specified in subsection to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification as a treaty or alternatively the President should request statutory authorization for the status of forces agreement by Congress. Submission to Congress.-- In general.--The President shall submit to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate a copy of the status of forces agreement specified in subsection . The status of forces agreement shall be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex if necessary. Availability.--Any Senator or Member of the House of Representatives may review the copy of the status of forces agreement submitted under paragraph , including any portions of the agreement contained in the classified annex.

<ROW>27</ROW><BILL>"This Act may be cited as the ``Ensuring Defense Support to Catastrophic Incident Response Act of 2008''. Congress makes the following findings: The United States faces real threats of man-made and natural disasters which could result in catastrophic consequences to the Nation, its resources, and its people. Because of the scale of the potential consequences of these threats, they may constitute threats to national security and will require the full range of Federal resources to save lives, minimize human suffering, protect property, and mitigate damage. Because of its manpower, communications, logistics, and other capabilities, the Department of Defense is uniquely suited to provide critical support to other departments and agencies of the Federal Government, State and local governments, and governments of the Commonwealths and possessions of the United States in response to a catastrophic incident in the United States. Planning and preparation for and execution of civil support operations in responding to catastrophic incidents in support of the Department of Homeland Security and State and local governments is a national security issue. A successful response to catastrophic incidents in the United States requires coordinated strategic plans and detailed operational plans with specific tasking and sourcing. The Department of Defense must develop such plans and should maintain the required units and assets at the appropriate level of readiness in order to deliver the capabilities which will be required in a response led by the Department of Homeland Security. The National Guard and Reserves are forward-deployed in communities throughout the United States, are integrated with State and local governments, and have considerable homeland- related capabilities. The Department of Defense and the United States Northern Command must therefore consider the plans and capabilities of the National Guard and Reserves, and State and local governments, in plans for civil support operations.

<ROW>35</ROW><BILL>"Congress finds the following: According to a 2003 Government Accountability Office report, even after accounting for factors such as occupation, industry, race, marital status, job tenure, and differing work patterns, all of which affect earnings, women are paid, on average, 80 cents compared to every dollar that men are paid. According to the same report, the earnings gap between men and women has persisted without statistically significant changes for the past two decades. According to a 2001 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the earnings gap among working men and women is widest among parents. Some women choose to trade advancing in their careers or higher earnings for a job offering the flexibility to manage family responsibilities alongside work. According to a 2001 Government Accountability Office study, in 1995 and 2000, female full-time managers earned less than their male counterparts. According to the same study, in 7 of the 10 industries studied, the earnings gap between female and male full-time managers actually widened between 1995 and 2000. Women make up 46 percent of the workforce but represent just 12 percent of all corporate officers. A reason for the continuing earnings disparity might be discrimination as to which roles are considered acceptable for men and women and how women are viewed in the workplace. According to the February 2004 Monthly Labor Review of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Labor projects that the United States work force is growing at a rate of 1 percent per year, in part due to the continually increased presence of women.

Presidential Authority.--The President shall issue such orders and regulations, and establish such procedures and reporting requirements, as the President determines to be appropriate to ensure that no pharmaceutical product (as defined by the President in such regulation or order) is sold to any consumer in the United States at a price that is more than 6 percent above the average retail price at which such pharmaceutical product is sold in the 5 most industrialized, free-market countries, other than the United States, as determined by the President.

<ROW>51</ROW><BILL>"This Act may be cited as the ``National Advisory Commission on Tax Reform and Simplification Act of 2001''. The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission to study and report back to Congress recommendations on simplifying, reforming, or replacing the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Congress finds the following: The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is overly complex, imposes significant burdens on individuals, businesses, and the economy, is extremely difficult for the Internal Revenue Service to administer, and is in need of fundamental reform and simplification. Many of the problems encountered by taxpayers in dealing with the Internal Revenue Service--especially those arising from misunderstandings of the Code--could be eliminated or alleviated by fundamental reform and simplification. The Internal Revenue Service faces continual difficulty in administering an overly lengthy, complex, and confusing tax code. Taxpayers and tax experts have repeatedly called for a simplification of the current tax code. The complexity of the current code places a significant burden on individual filers, including extensive record keeping, time requirements to prepare returns, gaining an understanding of the exemptions for which they may qualify, and other burdens. This has forced the majority of taxpayers to turn to tax professionals to prepare their tax returns. Congress is continually modifying and correcting the Code, leading to annual uncertainty and only adding to the patchwork of complexity and confusion. The Federal Government's present fiscal outlook for continuing and sustained budget surpluses provides a unique opportunity for the Congress to consider measures for fundamental reform and simplification of the tax laws. Recent efforts to simplify or reform the tax laws have not been successful due in part to the difficulty of developing broad-based, nonpartisan support for proposals to make such changes. SIMPLIFICATION. In General.--To carry out the purposes of this Act, there is established within the legislative branch a National Advisory Commission on Tax Reform and Simplification (in this Act referred to as the ``Commission''), comprised of 15 members. The membership of the Commission shall be as follows: 3 members appointed by the President, 2 from the executive branch of the Government and 1 from private life. 4 members appointed by the majority leader of the Senate, 1 from Members of the Senate and 3 from private life. 2 members appointed by the minority leader of the Senate, 1 from Members of the Senate and 1 from private life. 4 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, 1 from Members of the House of Representatives and 3 from private life. 2 members appointed by the minority leader of the House of Representatives, 1 from Members of the House of Representatives and 1 from private life. Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the President and congressional leadership should draw from a number of important areas of expertise in composing the Commission, including tax experts familiar with corporate tax issues, international tax issues, small business tax issues, and family and individual tax issues. Appointments.--Appointments to the Commission shall be made not later than 45 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. Quorum.--Nine members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum for conducting the business of the Commission. Initial Meeting.--If, after 60 days from the date of the enactment of this Act, 5 or more members of the Commission have been appointed, members who have been appointed may meet and select the Chair (or Co-chairs) who thereafter shall have the authority to begin the operations of the Commission, including the hiring of staff. Rules.--The Commission may adopt such other rules as it considers appropriate. Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the Commission shall not affect its powers, but shall be filled in the same manner in which the original appointment was made. Any meeting of the Commission or any subcommittee thereof may be held in executive session to the extent that the Chair (Co-Chairs, if elected) or a majority of the members of the Commission or subcommittee determine appropriate. Continuation of Membership.--Any individual who appointed a member to the Commission by virtue of holding a position described in section 4 ceases to hold such position before the report of the Commission is submitted, that member may continue as a member for not longer than the 30-day period beginning on the date that such individual ceases to hold such position.

<ROW>54</ROW><BILL>"This Act may be cited as the ``Sportsmen's Bill of Rights Act''. Findings.--The Congress finds the following: Fishing is an important and traditional recreational activity in which 36,000,000 Americans 16 years old and older participate. Hunting is an important and traditional recreational activity in which 14,000,000 Americans 16 years old and older participate. Survey data from a recent comprehensive 3-year study entitled ``Factors Related to Hunting and Fishing Participation in the United States'' suggest that an overwhelming majority of Americans approved of fishing and hunting. Anglers and hunters have been and continue to be among the foremost supporters of sound wildlife management and conservation practices in the United States. Persons who hunt or fish and organizations related to those activities provide direct assistance to wildlife managers and enforcement officers of Federal, State, and local governments. Funds raised through license, permit, and stamp purchases, as well as through excise taxes on goods used by anglers and hunters, have generated more than $6,000,000,000 for wildlife research and management. Fishing and hunting are essential components of effective wildlife management, in that they tend to reduce conflicts between people and wildlife and provide incentives for the conservation of wildlife and habitats and ecosystems on which wildlife depends. Each State has established one or more agencies staffed by professionally trained fish and wildlife management personnel, has legal authority to manage the fish and wildlife found within the State, and carries out sound programs of fish and wildlife management. Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that in performing duties under Federal law, all Federal agencies that have authority to manage a natural resource or the Federal public land and water on which a natural resource depends shall exercise the authority, consistent with section 3, in a manner so as to support, promote, and enhance hunting and fishing opportunities to the extent permitted under State law and regulation and in accordance with applicable Federal law. In General.--Federal public land and water shall be open to access and use for fishing and hunting except-- as limited by the State in which the Federal public land or water is located; or as limited by the Federal agency responsible for the Federal public land or water-- for reasons of national security; for reasons of public safety; or for reasons specifically authorized in applicable statutes. Limitations on Terms of Federal Closure to Fishing or Hunting.-- Limitation on duration.--Any closure of Federal public land or water to fishing or hunting may continue in effect only during the period in which the specific circumstances for which the closure is established exist. Rule of construction.--Any authority of a Federal agency to close particular land or water to hunting or fishing shall not be construed as authority to protect or manage fish or wildlife. Certain Federal Public Land and Water Administered by the National Park Service.--Nothing in this Act shall compel the opening to hunting or fishing of national parks or national monuments administered by the National Park Service. No Priority.--This section does not require a Federal agency to give preference to fishing or hunting over other uses of Federal public land or water or land or water management priorities established in Federal law. Authority of the States.-- In general.--Nothing in this Act impairs the primacy of State authority in regulating the taking of fish and wildlife on land or water within the State, including Federal public land or water. Federal authority.--Except as expressly provided by Act of Congress, the authority of a Federal agency regarding the taking of fish and wildlife on Federal public land or water managed by the Federal agency shall be no greater than the rights of a private owner of land or water. Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act.--The Act entitled ``An Act to provide that the United States shall aid the States in wildlife- restoration projects, and for other purposes'', approved September 2, 1937 (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.; commonly known as the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act), is amended-- by striking ``Secretary of Agriculture'' each place it appears and inserting ``Secretary of the Interior''; and in section 4 by adding at the end the following: ``The amount of funding made available to the Secretary of the Interior for expenses under this section shall not be available for use as a supplement to decreased funding for any other expense under the authority of the Secretary of the Interior.''. Federal Aid in Fish Restoration Act.--Section 4 of the Act entitled ``An Act to provide that the United States shall aid the States in fish restoration and management projects, and for other purposes'', approved August 9, 1950 (16 U.S.C. 777c; commonly known as the Federal Aid in Fish Restoration Act), is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The amount of funding made available to the Secretary of the Interior for expenses under this section shall not be available for use as a supplement to decreased funding for any other expense under the authority of the Secretary of the Interior.''. Statement.--No Federal agency action that may significantly diminish opportunities or access to engage in fishing or hunting on Federal public land or water shall be effective until the agency prepares a detailed statement evaluating the effect of the action on fishing and hunting. Notice and Hearing.--Before taking an action described in subsection , a Federal agency shall-- provide notice of the proposed agency action to the appropriate State agency responsible for the conduct or oversight of fish and wildlife management; and conduct a public hearing in the vicinity of the proposed action. Judicial Review.--An individual or entity that may be adversely affected by a loss of fishing or hunting opportunities on Federal public land or water as a result of an agency action described in subsection may bring a civil action in a United States district court for review of the adequacy of the statement required in subsection . Emergencies.--Nothing in this section precludes an agency from exercising statutory authority to close Federal public land or water in an emergency or other exigent circumstances. Effect on Other Law.--Nothing in this section affects or has application to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) or the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.). Intervention.--A person interested in participating in fishing or hunting shall be entitled to intervene as a matter of right in a civil action brought under any other Federal law relating to the use of any Federal public land or water in which the plaintiff seeks an order that would require the use (or nonuse) of the land or water in such a manner as to impair access to or use of the land or water for the purpose of fishing or hunting as required by this Act. Consideration of Interests.--If an intervenor under subsection shows that the application of another Federal law as sought by the plaintiff would be likely to impair access to or use of the Federal public land or water for the purpose of fishing or hunting as required by this Act, the court shall not grant the relief sought unless the plaintiff shows that the interest intended to be advanced by the other Federal law clearly outweighs the interest of protecting access to and use of Federal public land or water for fishing and hunting. State Deemed Indispensable Party.--In any civil action brought in any United States district court under any other Federal law relating to the use of any Federal public land or water, a State is deemed an indispensable party if management by the State of fish and resident wildlife, including hunting and fishing, would be curtailed or if opportunities provided by the State for hunting and fishing would be reduced or eliminated by a grant of preliminary or final relief. An individual who is licensed by a State to engage in fishing or hunting, or an organization representing the interests of such individuals, may bring a civil action in a United States district court to seek declaratory or injunctive relief regarding the implementation of any provision of this Act, including a declaration that a civil action brought by another person may significantly disrupt or eliminate opportunities for fishing or hunting and an injunction against the prosecution of the civil action. As used in this Act: Hunting and fishing.--For any State, the terms ``hunting'' and ``fishing'' include all means and methods of taking fish and wildlife as authorized and regulated by the State agency responsible for the conduct or oversight of fish and wildlife management. Federal public land or water.--The term ``Federal public land or water''-- except as provided in subparagraph , means all lands and waters owned in fee by the United States and all property interests owned by the United States in land or water, including easements, that are administered by-- the Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of Land Management, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, or the Bureau of Reclamation; the Secretary of Agriculture through the United States Forest Service; or the Secretary of Defense through the United States Army Corps of Engineers or pursuant to the Sikes Act (16 U.S.C. 670a et seq.); and does not include any land or water, or interest in land or water, that is part of a national park or national monument, administered by the National Park Service."</BILL><SUMMARY>Sportsmen's Bill of Rights  This bill establishes the National Fish and Game Conservation Commission as the primary agency of the Commission on Fish and Wildlife Protection (FWC) to administer and enforce the Wildlife Act of 1974.Requires Federal agencies to exercise their authority to manage a natural resource or federal public land and water in a manner so as to support, promote, and enhance hunting and fishing opportunities.Federal agency authority to close any federal land or water to fishing or hunting shall not be construed as authority to protect or manage fish or wildlife.

<ROW>59</ROW><BILL>"This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Rental Housing Act of 2003''. Congress makes the following findings: There is a pressing and increasing need for rental housing for rural families and senior citizens, as evidenced by the fact that-- two-thirds of extremely low-income and very low-income rural households do not have access to affordable rental housing units; more than 900,000 rural rental households (10.4 percent) live in either severely or moderately inadequate housing; and substandard housing is a problem for 547,000 rural renters, and approximately 165,000 rural rental units are overcrowded. Many rural United States households live with serious housing problems, including a lack of basic water and wastewater services, structural insufficiencies, and overcrowding, as shown by the fact that-- 28 percent, or 10,400,000, rural households in the United States live with some kind of serious housing problem; approximately 1,000,000 rural renters have multiple housing problems; and an estimated 2,600,000 rural households live in substandard housing with severe structural damage or without indoor plumbing, heat, or electricity. In rural America-- one-third of all renters pay more than 30 percent of their income for housing; 20 percent of rural renters pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing; and 92 percent of all rural renters with significant housing problems pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing costs, and 60 percent pay more than 70 percent of their income for housing. Rural economies are often less diverse, and therefore, jobs and economic opportunity are limited because-- factors that exist in rural environments, such as remoteness and low population density, lead to limited access to many forces driving the economy, such as technology, lending, and investment; and local expertise is often limited in rural areas where the economies are focused on farming or natural resource-based industries. Rural areas have less access to credit than metropolitan areas since-- banks and other investors that look for larger projects with lower risk seek metropolitan areas for loans and investment; credit that is available is often insufficient, leading to the need for interim or bridge financing; and credit in rural areas is often more expensive and available at less favorable terms than in metropolitan areas. The Federal Government investment in rural rental housing has dropped during the last 10 years, as evidenced by the fact that-- Federal spending for rural rental housing has been cut by 73 percent since 1994; and rural rental housing unit production financed by the Federal Government has been reduced by 88 percent since 1990. To address the scarcity of rural rental housing, the Federal Government must work in partnership with State and local governments, private financial institutions, private philanthropic institutions, and the private sector, including nonprofit organizations. In this Act: Eligible project.--The term ``eligible project'' means a project for the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of rental housing and related facilities in an eligible rural area for occupancy by low-income families.

Low-income families.--The term ``low-income families'' has the meaning given the term in section 3of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a). Qualified intermediary.--The term ``qualified intermediary'' means a State, a State agency designated by the Governor of the State, a public instrumentality of the State, a private nonprofit community development corporation, a nonprofit housing corporation, a community development loan fund, or a community development credit union, that-- has a record of providing technical and financial assistance for housing and community development activities in rural areas; and has a demonstrated technical and financial capacity to administer assistance made available under this Act. Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Agriculture. State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several States of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, and any other possession of the United States.

Priority for Assistance.--In selecting among applicants for assistance under this section, the Secretary, or a qualified intermediary, shall give priority to providing assistance to eligible projects-- for very low-income families (as defined in section 3of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a); and in low-income communities or in communities with a severe lack of affordable rental housing, in eligible rural areas, as determined by the Secretary; or if the applications are submitted by public agencies, Indian tribes, private nonprofit corporations or limited dividend corporations in which the general partner is a non- profit entity whose principal purposes include planning, developing and managing low-income housing and community development projects. Allocation of Assistance.-- In general.--In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall allocate assistance among the States, taking into account the incidence of rural substandard housing and rural poverty in each State and the share of that State of the national total of such incidence. Small state minimum.--In making an allocation under paragraph , the Secretary shall provide each state an amount not less than $2,000,000. Limitations on Amount of Assistance.-- In general.--Except as provided in paragraph , assistance made available under this Act may not exceed 50 percent of the total cost of the eligible project. Exception.--Assistance authorized under this Act shall not exceed 75 percent of the total cost of the eligible project, if the project is for the acquisition, rehabilitation, or construction of not more than 20 rental housing units for use by very low-income families.

<ROW>60</ROW><BILL>"Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Telecommunications Economic Opportunity Act of 1995''. Findings.--The Congress finds the following: It is in the public interest for business enterprises owned by minorities and women to participate in procurement contracts of all providers of telecommunications services. The opportunity for full participation in our free enterprise system by business enterprises that are owned by minorities and women is essential if this Nation is to attain social and economic equality for those businesses and improve the functioning of the national economy. It is in this Nation's interest to expeditiously improve the economically disadvantaged position of business enterprises that are owned by minorities and women. The position of these businesses can be improved through the development by the providers of telecommunications services of substantial long-range and annual goals, which are supported by training and technical assistance, for the purchase, to the maximum practicable extent, of technology, equipment, supplies, services, material and construction from minority business enterprises. Procurement policies which include participation of business enterprises that are owned by minorities and women also benefit the communication industry and its consumers by encouraging the expansion of the numbers of suppliers for procurement, thereby encouraging competition among suppliers and promoting economic efficiency in the process. The purposes of this Act are-- to encourage and foster greater economic opportunity for business enterprises that are owned by minorities and women; to promote competition among suppliers to providers of telecommunications services and their affiliates to enhance economic efficiency in the procurement of telephone corporation contracts and contracts of their State commission-regulated subsidiaries and affiliates; to clarify and expand a program for the procurement by State and federally-regulated telephone companies of technology, equipment, supplies, services, materials and construction work from business enterprises that are owned by minorities and women; and to ensure that a fair proportion of the total purchases, contracts, and subcontracts for supplies, commodities, technology, property, and services offered by the providers of telecommunications services and their affiliates are awarded to minority and women business enterprises. Annual Plans Required.-- In general.--The Commission shall require each provider of telecommunications services to submit annually a detailed and verifiable plan for increasing its procurement from business enterprises that are owned by minorities or women in all categories of procurement in which minorities are under represented. Contents of plans.--The annual plans required by paragraph shall include (but not be limited to) short- and long-term progressive goals and timetables, technical assistance, and training and shall, in addition to goals for direct contracting opportunities, include methods for encouraging both prime contractors and grantees to engage business enterprises that are owned by minorities and women in subcontracts in all categories in which minorities are under represented. Implementation report.--Each provider of telecommunications services shall furnish an annual report to the Commission regarding the implementation of programs established pursuant to this Act in such form as the Commission shall require, and at such time as the Commission shall annually designate. Report to congress.--The Commission shall provide an annual report to Congress, beginning in January 1996, on the progress of activities undertaken by each provider of telecommunications services regarding the implementation of activities pursuant to this Act to develop business enterprises that are owned by minorities or women. The report shall evaluate the accomplishments under this Act and shall recommend a program for enhancing the policy declared in this Act, together with such recommendations for legislation as it deems necessary or desirable to further that policy. Regulations and Criteria for Determining Eligibility of Minority Business Enterprises for Procurement Contracts.-- In general.--The Commission shall establish regulations for implementing programs pursuant to this Act that will govern providers of telecommunications services and their affiliates. Verifying criteria.--The Commission shall develop and publish regulations setting forth criteria for verifying and determining the eligibility of business enterprises that are owned by minorities or women for procurement contracts. Outreach.--The Commission's regulations shall require each provider of telecommunications services and its affiliates to develop and to implement an outreach program to inform and recruit business enterprises that are owned by minorities or women to apply for procurement contracts under this Act. Enforcement.--The Commission shall establish and promulgate such regulations necessary to enforce the provisions of this Act. Waiver Authority.--The requirements of this section may be waived, in whole or in part, by the Commission with respect to a particular contract or subcontract in accordance with guidelines set forth in regulations which the Commission shall prescribe when it determines that the application of such regulations prove to result in undue hardship or unreasonable expense to a provider of telecommunications services. False Representation of Businesses; Sanctions.-- In general.--Any person or corporation, through its directors, officers, or agent, which falsely represents the business as a business enterprise that is owned by minorities or women in the procurement or attempt to procure contracts from telephone operating companies and their affiliates pursuant to this article, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $5,000, or by imprisonment for a period not to exceed 5 years of its directors, officers, or agents responsible for the false statements, or by both fine and imprisonment. Holding companies.--Any provider of telecommunications services which falsely represents its annual report to the Commission or its implementation of its programs pursuant to this section shall be subject to a fine of $100,000 and be subject to a penalty of up to 5 years restriction from participation in lines of business activities provided for in this Act. Independent Cause of Action, Remedies, and Attorney Fees.-- Discrimination prohibited.--No otherwise qualified business enterprise that is owned by minorities or women shall solely, by reason of its racial, ethnic, or gender composition be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination in procuring contracts from telephone utilities. Civil actions authorized.--Whenever a qualified business enterprise that is owned by minorities or women has reasonable cause to believe that a provider of telecommunications services or its affiliate is engaged in a pattern or practice of resistance to the full compliance of any provision of this Act, the business enterprise may bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the United States against the provider of telecommunications services or its affiliate requesting such monetary or injunctive relief, or both, as deemed necessary to ensure the full benefits of this Act. Attorneys' fees and costs.--In any action or proceeding to enforce or charge of a violation of a provision of this Act, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. For the purpose of this Act, the following definitions apply: The term ``business enterprise owned by minorities or women'' means-- a business enterprise that is at least 51 percent owned by a person or persons who are minority persons or women; or in the case of any publicly owned business, at least 51 percent of the stock of which is owned by one or more persons who are minority persons or women, and whose management and daily business operations are controlled by one or more of those persons.

Approximately 8,864 Americans volunteered to join the RCAF beginning as early as 1940 and continuing throughout World War II. These RCAF-Americans came from every state in the Union. Many of the RCAF-Americans were urgently needed as flying instructors and helped to fully staff the BCATP operations. Approximately 750 Americans (244 with the highly regarded Eagle Squadrons) also served in Great Britain with the RAF. The Eagle Squadrons served from February, 1941, until September, 1942, and provided the British welcome relief from the stress of losing large numbers of combat pilots. President Franklin Roosevelt called the BCATP the ``Aerodrome Of Democracy''. Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King, General Dwight Eisenhower, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, all expressed their gratitude to the United States men and women who took part in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Approximately 3,794 Americans transferred to the U.S. Army Air Force after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The 3 Eagle Squadrons (No.71/No.121/No.133), transferred into the 4th Fighter Group, USAAF in September 1942. The transfer of these courageous RCAF/RAF-Americans helped prevent a shortage of experienced airmen in the aftermath of America's entry into the war. Many of these highly trained and experienced RCAF/RAF- Americans pilots performed crucial roles as flight instructors for the USAAF. The accumulated knowledge and skills possessed by these RCAF/RAF-American airmen resulted in many becoming highly accomplished USAAF combat pilots. One of the most highly decorated military groups, the American Fighter Aces, can count many of these RCAF/RAF- Americans among their venerable ranks. These brave Americans left their families to join the RCAF/RAF and over 800 lost their lives while serving. They represent the exceptional courage that has been displayed in the defense of Freedom throughout our Nation's history.

<ROW>62</ROW><BILL>"This Act may be cited as the ``Appalachian Regional Commission Reform Act''. Headquarters.--Congress finds that-- regional commissions, such as the Delta Regional Authority, the Denali Commission, and the Northern Border Regional Commission, are each headquartered in their respective region; headquartering regional commissions within the region affected is a sensible approach to ensure that the commissions are housed in more affordable locations than the District of Columbia, thereby reducing administrative overhead and making the commissions closer and more accountable to the people the commissions were designed to serve; the Appalachian Regional Commission (referred to in this Act as the ``Commission'') is not headquartered in Appalachia but in Washington, DC; and the headquarters of the Commission should be relocated from the District of Columbia to a more affordable location in the Appalachian region so that it is closer and more accountable to the people the Commission was designed to serve. Performance.--Congress finds that-- the Commission was created to help foster economic opportunity and close health and educational disparities in a geographic region of the United States beleaguered by persistent poverty and high unemployment; the Commission remains the sole Federal agency focused singularly on economic revitalization in the Appalachian region; in 1998, Congress charged the Commission with ``address[ing] the needs of severely and persistently distressed areas of the Appalachian region and focus[ing] special attention on the areas of greatest need''; the Commission has long been criticized for its shortcomings in fulfilling this mission, including in-- a 1999 study titled ``Mountain Money: Federal Tax Dollars Miss the Mark in Core Appalachia'' by Mark Ferenchik and Jill Ripenhoff for the Columbus Dispatch; and a 2008 book titled ``Uneven Ground: Appalachia Since 1945'' by Ronald D. Eller; in 2004, the Office of Management and Budget noted the importance of the Commission ``[f]ocusing efforts on . . . targeting assistance to areas of distress''; in 2017, Citizens Against Government Waste characterized the programming of the Commission as duplicative and called for drastic reductions in the budget of the Commission; in 2017, the Office of Management and Budget, citing a Government Accountability Office study, concluded that the Commission should be abolished, and that conclusion was reflected in the fiscal year 2018 budget request submitted by the President; these recent actions reflect a growing chorus that the Commission should be reformed; and therefore, given the long-recognized shortcomings of the Commission, the long-standing criticism of the Commission, and the need to ensure its optimal performance, the time has arrived for the Commission to be reformed. Persistent Poverty.--Congress finds that-- using 1960 data, the Commission (which was created in 1965) concluded that there were 214 distressed counties in the Appalachian region; in 2017, according to the Commission, there are 84 distressed counties in the Appalachian region, reflecting the areas of most persistent poverty in the region; and therefore, the Commission should be reformed to focus its attention on the areas of most persistent poverty in the region. Area Development Funding for Distressed Counties.--Congress finds that-- according to the study by the Columbus Dispatch referred to in subsection , of the 22,169 grants issued by the Commission from fiscal year 1966 through fiscal year 1998, none of the 5 counties that received the most Commission funding was considered distressed, and more than \1/ 4\ of all Commission spending during that period went to States with few, if any, distressed counties; according to author Ronald D. Eller in 2014, ``[the Commission] policies have concentrated resources in a select few `growth centers' in the [Appalachian] region, expanding services to the poor and growing the mountain middle class, but doing little to alter conditions in the most rural distressed counties or to address systemic political or economic inequalities throughout Appalachia''; until 1995, the Commission allocated up to 20 percent of its area development grants for use in distressed counties; following instructions given to the Commission by the Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of Representatives in 1995, this allocation was increased by the Commission to 30 percent; section 7.5of the Code of the Commission (as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act) reflects this 1995 policy change and states that the Commission ``will allocate up to 30 percent of Commission area development funds for use in distressed counties'', even though, according to the Commission's public representations, economic conditions in distressed areas of the Appalachian region have not greatly improved since the 1960s; given the persistent levels of poverty in the distressed counties in the Appalachian region, more area development funding and emphasis should be devoted to those counties; and therefore, the allocation described in paragraph should be increased to 60 percent. Grant Expenditures.--Congress finds that-- section 14524of title 40, United States Code, provides that ``not less than 50 percent of the amount of grant expenditures the Commission approves shall support activities or projects that benefit severely and persistently distressed counties and areas''; given the persistent levels of poverty in the distressed counties in the Appalachian region, more grant expenditures and emphasis should be devoted to those counties; and therefore, the 50 percent threshold in section 14524of title 40, United States Code, should be increased to 60 percent. Section 14301 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by striking subsection and inserting the following: ``Establishment and Mission.-- ``Establishment.--There is an Appalachian Regional Commission (referred to in this chapter as the `Commission'). ``Mission.--The mission of the Commission shall be to focus primarily on poverty reduction and economic development in areas in the Appalachian region with the most persistent poverty.''. In General.--Section 14301 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: ``Headquarters.--The headquarters of the Commission shall be located in the Appalachian region.''. Implementation.--The Federal Cochairman of the Commission shall take such actions as may be necessary to carry out the amendment made by subsection . Section 14524of title 40, United States Code, is amended by striking ``50 percent'' and inserting ``60 percent''. Section 14526of title 40, United States Code, is amended-- by striking ``In program and'' and inserting the following: ``In general.--In program and''; and by adding at the end the following: ``Area development funds.-- ``In general.--Of the funds made available for each fiscal year for the Area Development Program of the Commission, the Commission shall allocate not less than 60 percent for projects in counties for which a distressed county designation is in effect under this section. ``Methodology.--The methodology for determining whether a county is designated as a distressed county under subsection shall be the methodology in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the Appalachian Regional Commission Reform Act. ``Report.--The Commission shall submit an annual report that describes the allocation of funds, in dollar amounts and percentage of total appropriations, for the Area Development Program to counties described in paragraph to-- ``the Speaker of the House of Representatives; ``the minority leader of the House of Representatives; ``the majority leader of the Senate; ``the minority leader of the Senate; ``the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives; ``the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate; ``the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives; and ``the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate.''."</BILL><SUMMARY>Appalachian Regional Commission Reform Act - Directs the Commission to relocate from the District of Columbia to a more affordable location in the Appalachian Region, thereby reducing administrative overhead and making the commissions closer and more accountable to the people the commissions were designed to serve.Appalachian Regional Economic Revitalization Act of 1998 - Amends the Federal Emergency Management Act to direct the Bureau of Economic Affairs (FEMA) to: (1) address the needs of severely and persistently distressed areas of the Appalachian region; (2) focus[s] special attention on the areas of greatest need; and (3) report to Congress on the effectiveness of the Commission's efforts targeting assistance to areas of distress.Requires the Commission to be reformed to focus its attention on areas of persistent poverty.Requires the Commission to allocate up to 20% of area development funding for use in distressed counties.Requires the Commission to allocate up to 30 percent of its area development funds for use in distressed counties and areas, regardless of economic conditions in such areas.Requires the federal cochairman of the commission to take actions necessary to carry out the mission.Amends the Appalachian Regional Commission Act to: (1) require the Commission to allocate not less than 60 percent of funds for the area development program to distressed counties; and (2) establish a methodology for determining whether a county is designated as a distressed county.Directs the Speaker of the House of Representatives to appoint and report to the Senate on appropriations.</SUMMARY><BILL_FROM>../../preprocess/data/clean_billsum_test.csv</BILL_FROM><SUMMARY_FROM>../../output/deliverable_4/wugNATSS-led/eval_on_unsimp.csv</SUMMARY_FROM><ALIGNSCORE>0.8706936240196228</ALIGNSCORE>

<ROW>70</ROW><BILL>"This Act may be cited as the ``Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 1998''. Findings.--The Congress finds the following: Manufacturers of prescription drugs engage in price discrimination practices that compel many older Americans to pay substantially more for prescription drugs than the drug manufacturers' most favored customers, such as health insurers, health maintenance organizations, and the Federal Government. On average, older Americans who buy their own prescription drugs pay twice as much for prescription drugs as the drug manufacturers' most favored customers. In some cases, older Americans pay over 15 times more for prescription drugs than the most favored customers. The discriminatory pricing by major drug manufacturers sustains their annual profits of $20,000,000,000, but causes financial hardship and impairs the health and well-being of millions of older Americans. More than one in eight older Americans are forced to choose between buying their food and buying their medicines. Most federally funded health care programs, including Medicaid, the Veterans Health Administration, the Public Health Service, and the Indian Health Service, obtain prescription drugs for their beneficiaries at low prices. Medicare beneficiaries are denied this benefit and cannot obtain their prescription drugs at the favorable prices available to other federally funded health care programs. It has been estimated that implementation of the policy set forth in this Act will reduce prescription prices for Medicare beneficiaries by more than 40 percent. In addition to substantially lowering health care costs for older Americans, implementation of the policy set forth in this Act will significantly improve the health and well-being of older Americans and lower the costs to the Federal taxpayer of the Medicare program. Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect Medicare beneficiaries from discriminatory pricing by drug manufacturers and to make prescription drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at substantially reduced prices, by allowing pharmacies to purchase drugs for Medicare beneficiaries at the substantially reduced price available under the Federal Supply Schedule. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall furnish to each Medicare beneficiary a drug benefit card that enables the beneficiary to purchase covered prescription drugs from participating pharmacies at reduced prices pursuant to section 4. Agreements to Participate.--Any qualified pharmacy may enter into an agreement with the Secretary that enables the pharmacy to sell covered outpatient drugs to holders of Medicare drug benefit cards at a reduced price, by authorizing the pharmacy to operate as a participating pharmacy under this Act. Right of Participating Pharmacies To Obtain Drugs.--An agreement under this section shall entitle the participating pharmacy to purchase any covered outpatient drug that is listed on the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration at the participating pharmacy discount price for that drug determined under subsection . Quantity of Drugs Purchased.--An agreement under this section shall permit the participating pharmacy to purchase under this Act as much of a covered outpatient drug as is sold by the pharmacy to holders of Medicare drug benefit cards. Participating Pharmacy Discount Price.-- In general.--The Secretary shall determine a participating pharmacy discount price for each covered outpatient drug. Determination.--The participating pharmacy discount price for a covered outpatient drug shall be determined by adding-- the price at which the drug is available to Federal agencies from the Federal Supply Schedule under section 8126 of title 38, United States Code; plus an amount that reflects the administrative costs incurred by the Secretary in administering this Act. In General.--The Secretary shall administer this Act in a manner that uses existing methods of obtaining and distributing drugs to the maximum extent possible, consistent with efficiency and cost effectiveness. Regulations.--The Secretary shall issue such regulations as may be necessary to implement this Act. In General.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall report to the Congress regarding the effectiveness of this Act in-- protecting Medicare beneficiaries from discriminatory pricing by drug manufacturers; and making prescription drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at substantially reduced prices. Consultation.--In preparing such reports, the Secretary shall consult with public health experts, affected industries, organizations representing consumers and older Americans, and other interested persons. Recommendations.--The Secretary shall include in such reports any recommendations they consider appropriate for changes in this Act to further reduce the cost of covered outpatient drugs to Medicare beneficiaries. In this Act: Covered outpatient drug.--The term ``covered outpatient drug'' has the meaning given that term in section 1927of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-8). Medicare beneficiary.--The term ``Medicare beneficiary'' means an individual entitled to benefits under part A of title XVIII of the Social Security Act or enrolled under part B of such title, or both.

Current studies indicate that the prevalence of psoriasis in the United States ranges between two and three percent, affecting approximately 7.5 million men, women, and children of all ages, approximately 17,000 individuals in each congressional district, and has an adverse impact on the quality of life for virtually all affected. Psoriasis often is overlooked or dismissed because it is not typically a direct cause of death. Psoriasis is commonly and incorrectly considered by insurers, employers, policymakers, and the public as a mere annoyance--a superficial problem, mistakenly thought to be contagious, due to poor hygiene, or both. As such, treatment for psoriasis is often incorrectly categorized as ``cosmetic'' and not ``medically necessary''. Psoriasis is connected with an elevated risk for other serious, chronic, and life-threatening comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer. A higher prevalence of stroke, atherosclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , Crohn's disease, lymphoma, metabolic syndrome, and liver disease are also found in people with psoriasis as compared to the general population. Up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop potentially disabling psoriatic arthritis. The National Institute of Mental Health funded a study that found that psoriasis may cause as much physical and mental disability as other major chronic diseases, including cancer, arthritis, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and depression. Psoriasis is associated with elevated rates of depression, anxiety, and suicidality (suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts, and completed suicides). Individuals with psoriasis are twice as likely to have thoughts of suicide as people without psoriasis or with other chronic conditions. The risk of premature death is 50 percent higher for people with severe psoriasis. This translates to people with severe psoriasis dying four years earlier, on average, than people without psoriasis. The economic consequences of psoriasis, both for individuals and the health care system, are significant. Total direct and indirect health care costs of psoriasis are calculated at $11,250,000,000 with work loss accounting for 40 percent of the cost burden. People with psoriasis have significantly higher health care resource utilization and costs than the general population. Additionally, psoriasis patients with comorbidities are more likely to experience urgent care, have greater rates of hospitalization, more frequent outpatient visits, and incur greater costs than psoriasis patients without comorbidities. Early diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis may help prevent irreversible joint damage. Treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis presents a challenge for patients and their health care providers. A wide range of treatment options is available; however, adverse side effects and success varies from patient to patient. The same treatments do not work for every patient and a treatment that may have been effective for a period of time can stop working. Despite a number of recent breakthroughs that have led to some new treatments, too many people with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis still cannot live normal lives. For many of these individuals, existing treatments are not effective or appropriate or may not be accessible due to cost and insurance barriers. Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis constitute a significant national health issue that deserves a comprehensive and coordinated response by States and the Federal Government with involvement of the health care provider, patient, and public health communities. In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is authorized to undertake psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis data collection efforts, including incorporating questions into public health surveys, questionnaires, and other databases in existence as of the date of the enactment of this Act to collect information, with respect to psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, regarding-- the prevalence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the United States; the age of onset; health-related quality of life; health care utilization; burden of such disease (such as with respect to employment); direct and indirect costs; health disparities, including with respect to age, gender, race, and ethnicity; and comorbidities and the natural history of such disease. Such data collection efforts may include the consideration and development of a patient registry, which would include individuals of all ages. Authorization of Appropriations.--To carry out subsection , there are authorized to be appropriated $1,500,000 for each of fiscal years 2012 through 2017. ON PSORIASIS AND PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS AND COMORBID CONDITIONS. It is the sense of the Congress that-- the psoriasis research community has made significant strides in proving the seriousness of psoriasis as an autoimmune disease and in advancing the identification of commonalities between psoriasis and other diseases; the nonprofit and private sector psoriasis research communities are to be commended for planning a multidisciplinary scientific meeting in 2012 to discuss future directions of psoriasis and comorbid research, identify initiatives necessary to fill any gaps, leverage public and private investments in psoriasis research, and facilitate progress in interdisciplinary research related to psoriasis and its comorbid conditions; the National Institutes of Health is encouraged to continue to work with the organizations and private sector stakeholders who convene the multidisciplinary scientific meeting to discuss future directions of psoriasis and comorbid research; the nonprofit and private sector meeting conveners should disseminate to the public, Congress, and other relevant public and private policymaking and research entities a report that includes findings from the scientific meeting and suggestions regarding next steps, including recommendations from the National Institutes of Health and other relevant Federal agencies; and utilizing the information produced by the scientific meeting regarding future directions of psoriasis and comorbid research, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health, and in conjunction with the National Institute for Arthritis, Musculoskeletal, and Skin Diseases and other institutes and centers of the National Institutes of Health, is encouraged to explore the development of a virtual Center of Excellence for Collaborative Discovery in Psoriasis and Comorbid Research or some other mechanism through which public and private sector findings regarding psoriasis and its comorbid conditions can be regularly shared and leveraged."</BILL><SUMMARY>The Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research, Cure, and Care Act of 2011 - This bill directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to investigate and report on the prevalence of psoriasis in the United States and the effects it has on the quality of life for virtually all affected individuals.The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NICHE) have jointly funded a study that found that psoriasis may cause as much physical and mental disability as other major chronic diseases, including heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and depression.Prohibits people with psoriasis from having thoughts of suicide, as well as having a higher risk of premature death.Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to undertake a national psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis data collection program to collect information regarding: (1) the prevalence of psoritis and psoratic arthritis in the United States; (2) the number of patients with psorismatic arthritis; (3) the total number of treatments available; and (4) the effectiveness of existing treatments, including those that may have been effective for a period of time, can stop working.Prohibits the Congress from appropriating funds for the purposes of: (1) collecting and processing data on the prevalence and incidence of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis in the United States; (2) the treatment and prevention of such disease; and (3) the study of a patient registry.

<ROW>93</ROW><BILL>"This Act may be cited as the ``Irrigation Subsidy Reduction Act of 1996''. Congress finds that-- the Federal reclamation program has been in existence for over 90 years, with an estimated taxpayer investment of over $70,000,000,000; the program has had and continues to have an enormous effect on the water resources and aquatic environments of the western States; irrigation water made available from Federal water projects in the West is a very valuable resource for which there are increasing and competing demands; the justification for providing water at less than full cost was to benefit and promote the development of small family farms and exclude large corporate farms, but this purpose has been frustrated over the years due to inadequate implementation of subsidy and acreage limits; below-cost water prices tend to encourage excessive use of scarce water supplies in the arid regions of the West, and reasonable price increases to the wealthiest western farmers would provide an economic incentive for greater water conservation; the Federal Government has increasingly applied eligibility tests based on income for Federal entitlement and subsidy programs, measures that are consistent with the historic approach of the reclamation program's acreage limitations that seek to limit water subsidies to smaller farms; and including a means test based on gross income in the reclamation program will increase the effectiveness of carrying out the family farm goals of the Federal reclamation laws.

<ROW>95</ROW><BILL>"Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Preserving Equitable Access to Community-based Home Health Act of 2009''. Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to preserve access to home health services for all Americans, regardless of their ability to pay or their severity of illness. The Congress finds the following: The Medicare home health benefit is vulnerable to agency selection of the most profitable beneficiaries and avoidance of the most complex and costly beneficiaries. Such ``cherry picking'' by some home health agencies compromises access to care for the most complex, highest risk beneficiaries. The Government Accountability Office has reported that hospital discharge planners have difficulty placing more than 10 percent of eligible patients in home health due to their extensive care needs. Proposals to reduce Medicare payments to home health agencies (in response to large aggregate margins across all home health agencies) may undermine the financial viability of mission-driven and non-profit home health agencies, which often have low to negative margins, while allowing high-margin agencies to remain in operation. In General.--There shall be established a fund (to be known as the ``PEACH fund'') from which home health agencies meeting specified criteria shall be paid supplemental amounts in addition to their statutory payment amounts under title XVIII of the Social Security Act. Is this to be a trust fund? Where is this fund to be established? Who adminsters it? What are the sources of funding that goes into the fund? What are the allowed uses of such funding?
