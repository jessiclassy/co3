505,505,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""broadband regulatory parity act of 2002"". sec. 2. findings. congress makes the following findings: (1) the cable modem service offered by cable operators for high-speed access to the internet is functionally equivalent to, and competes with, digital subscriber line service offered by local exchange carriers. (2) cable modem services and digital subscriber line services are subject to disparate regulatory treatment by the federal government and by state and local governments. (3) competing and functionally equivalent products and services should be regulated, or not regulated, in the same manner, regardless of who provides such products or services. (4) the federal communications commission is best positioned to determine which, if any, regulatory requirements for broadband access services should be retained and which, if any, should be eliminated. (5) the commission should be required to ensure that providers of broadband services are regulated in an equivalent manner, regardless of the platform used to provide such services. (6) government regulation should not favor or advantage one class of competitors among competitors offering similar products or services. (7) the deployment of digital subscriber line service has been restrained by regulatory requirements that are inappropriate for a competitive service offered by various non- dominant providers. (8) inappropriate regulation imposes needless costs and results in higher consumer costs. (9) lower consumer costs will accelerate demand for high- speed internet access services. (10) regulatory certainty and parity will provide incentives to increase deployment of high-speed internet services, bringing the benefits of such services to communities in the form of enhancements in medicine, education, national security, work from home, and other benefits. (11) the united states lags behind many other countries in the deployment of high-speed data services. (12) when all providers of broadband services compete under the same rules, consumers will benefit from increased choices and lower prices. sec. 3. parity in regulatory treatment of broadband service providers and broadband access service providers. (a) in general. --part ii of title ii of the communications act of 1934 (47 u.s.c. 251 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ""sec. 262. parity in regulatory treatment of broadband service providers and broadband access service providers.
