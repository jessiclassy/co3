675,675,2675,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""local control of broadcast towers act"". sec. 2. findings and purpose. (a) findings. --congress makes the following findings: (1) the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities near residential communities and facilities such as schools can greatly reduce the value of residential properties, destroy the views from properties, produce radio frequency interference, raise concerns about potential long-term health effects of such facilities, and reduce substantially the desire to live in the areas of such facilities. (2) states and local governments have traditionally regulated development and should be able to exercise control over the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities through the use of zoning and other land use regulations relating to the protection of the environment, public health and safety, and the general welfare of the community and the public. (3) the federal communications commission establishes policies to govern interstate and international communications by television, radio, wire, satellite, and cable. the commission ensures compliance of such activities with applicable federal laws, including the national environmental policy act of 1969 and the national historic preservation act, in its decision-making on such activities. (4) the commission defers to state and local authorities which regulate the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities through the use of zoning, construction and building, and environmental and safety regulations in order to protect the environment and the health, safety, and general welfare of communities and the public. (5) on august 19, 1997, the commission issued a proposed rule, mm docket no. 97-182, which would preempt the application of most state and local zoning, environmental, construction and building, and other regulations affecting the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities. (6) the telecommunications industry and its experts should be expected to have access to the best and most recent technical information and should therefore be held to the highest standards in terms of their representations, assertions, and promises to governmental authorities. (b) purpose. --the purpose of this act is to confirm that state and local governments are the appropriate entities-- (1) to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities consistent with state and local zoning, construction and building, environmental, and land use regulations; (2) to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities so that their placement, construction, or modification will not interfere with the safe and efficient use of public airspace or otherwise compromise or endanger the health, safety, and general welfare of the public; and (3) to hold accountable applicants for permits for the placement, construction, or modification of broadcast transmission facilities, and providers of services using such facilities, for the truthfulness and accuracy of representations and statements placed in the record of hearings for such permits, licenses, or approvals. sec. 3. prohibition on adoption of rule regarding preemption of state and local authority over broadcast transmission facilities. notwithstanding any other provision of law, the federal communications commission shall not adopt as a final rule or otherwise directly or indirectly implement any portion of the proposed rule set forth in ""preemption of state and local zoning and land use restrictions on siting, placement and construction of broadcast station transmission facilities"", mm docket no. 97-182, released august 19, 1997. sec. 4. authority over placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities. part i of title iii of the communications act of 1934 (47 u.s.c. 301 et seq. ) is amended by adding at the end the following: ""sec. 340. state and local authority over placement, construction, and modification of broadcast transmission facilities.
