518,518,2535,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""lake erie western basin international wildlife refuge establishment act"". sec. 2. findings. the congress finds the following: (1) the western basin of lake erie, as part of the great lakes ecosystem, the largest freshwater ecosystem on the face of the earth, is vitally important to the economic and environmental future of the united states. (2) over the past three decades, the citizens and governmental institutions of both the united states and canada have devoted increasing attention and resources to the restoration of the water quality and fisheries of the great lakes, including the western basin. this increased awareness has been accompanied by a gradual shift to a holistic ""ecosystem approach"" that highlights a growing recognition that shoreline areas--the nearshore terrestrial ecosystems--are an integral part of the western basin and the great lakes ecosystem as a whole. (3) the great lakes account for more than 90 percent of the surface freshwater in the nation. the western basin receives approximately 90 percent of its flow from the detroit river and only approximately 10 percent from tributaries. (4) the western basin of lake erie is an important ecosystem that includes a number of distinct islands, channels, rivers, and shoals that support dense populations of fish, wildlife, and aquatic plants. (5) the coastal wetlands of lake erie support the largest diversity of plant and wildlife species in the great lakes. the moderate climate of lake erie and its more southern latitude allow for many species that are not found in or along the northern great lakes. more than 300 species of plants, including 37 significant species, have been identified in the aquatic and wetland habitats of the western basin. (6) the shallow western basin, from the lower detroit river to sandusky bay, is home to the largest concentration of marshes in lake erie, including mouille, metzger, and magee marshes, the maumee bay wetland complex, the wetland complexes flanking locust point, and the wetlands in sandusky bay. the larger united states islands in western lake erie have wetlands in the small ebayments. (7) the wetlands in the western basin of lake erie comprise as some of the most important waterfowl habitat in the great lakes. waterfowl, wading birds, shore birds, gulls and terns, raptors, and perching birds all use the western basin wetlands for migration, nesting, and feeding. hundreds of thousands of diving ducks stop to rest in the lake erie area on their fall migration from canada to the east and south. the wetlands of the western basin provide a major stopover for sea ducks such as migrating bufflehead, common goldeneye, common mergansers, and ruddy duck. (8) the international importance of lake erie is manifested in the united states congressional designation of the ottawa and cedar point national wildlife refuges. (9) lake erie has an international reputation for walleye, perch, and bass fishing, recreational boating, birding, photography, and duck hunting. on an economic basis, lake erie tourism accounts for an estimate $1,500,000,000 in retail sales and more than 50,000 jobs. (10) many of the 417,000 boats that are registered in ohio are used in the western basin of lake erie, in part to fish for the estimated 10,000,000 walleye that migrate from the lake to spawn. this internationally renowned walleye fishery drives much of ohio's $2,000,000,000 sport fishing industry. (11) coastal wetlands in the western basin have been subjected to intense pressure for 150 years. prior to 1850, the western basin was part of an extensive coastal marsh and swamp system of approximately 122,000 hectares that comprised a portion of the great black swamp. by 1951, only 12,407 wetland hectares remained in the western basin. half of that acreage was destroyed between 1972 and 1987. therefore, today only approximately 5,000 hectares remain. along the michigan shoreline, coastal wetlands were reduced by 62 percent between 1916 and the early 1970s. the development of the city of monroe has had a particularly significant impact on the coastal wetlands at the mouth of the raisin river: only approximately 100 hectares remain physically unaltered today in an area where 70 years ago marshes were 10 times more extensive. in addition to the actual loss of coastal wetland acreage along the shores of lake erie, the quality of many remaining wetlands has been degraded by numerous stressors, especially excessive loadings of sediments and nutrients, contaminants, shoreline modification, exotic species, and the diking of wetlands. protective peninsula beach systems, such as the former bay point and woodtick, at the border of ohio and michigan near the mouth of the ottawa river and maumee bay, have been eroded over the years, exacerbating erosion along the shorelines and impacting the breeding and spawning grounds. sec. 3. definitions. for purposes of this act: (1) the term ""refuge"" means the lake erie western basin international wildlife refuge established by section 5.

(2) over the past three decades, the citizens and governmental institutions of both the united states and canada have devoted increasing attention and resources to the restoration of the water quality and fisheries of the great lakes, including the western basin. this increased awareness has been accompanied by a gradual shift to a holistic ""ecosystem approach"" that highlights a growing recognition that shoreline areas--the nearshore terrestrial ecosystems--are an integral part of the western basin and the great lakes ecosystem as a whole. (3) the great lakes account for more than 90 percent of the surface freshwater in the nation. the western basin receives approximately 90 percent of its flow from the detroit river and only approximately 10 percent from tributaries. (4) the western basin of lake erie is an important ecosystem that includes a number of distinct islands, channels, rivers, and shoals that support dense populations of fish, wildlife, and aquatic plants. (5) the coastal wetlands of lake erie support the largest diversity of plant and wildlife species in the great lakes. the moderate climate of lake erie and its more southern latitude allow for many species that are not found in or along the northern great lakes. more than 300 species of plants, including 37 significant species, have been identified in the aquatic and wetland habitats of the western basin.
