967,967,973,"section 1.  short title; findings. (a) short title. --this act may be cited as the ""national policies toward gambling review act of 1995"". (b) findings. --the congress finds the following: (1) in 1976, the commission on the review of the national policy toward gambling issued its final report to congress. at the time of the report-- (a) casino gambling was legal in just 1 state, where it was a $1,000,000,000 a year industry; (b) indian tribal gambling did not exist; (c) state lotteries existed in just 13 states; and (d) the link between gambling and organized crime was the paramount concern of the commission. (2) the gambling industry has grown dramatically in recent years as demonstrated by the following: (a) casino gambling is legal in well over 20 states and referenda on legalization are being considered in many other states. (b) casino gambling has become a $30,000,000,000 a year industry. (c) indian tribal casino gambling accounts for over 15 percent of all casino revenues. (d) state lotteries exist in 36 states. (e) gambling in some form exists in all but 2 states in the union. (3) implementation of the indian gaming regulatory act in 1988 created a competitive environment between indian tribes and states to legalize and develop casinos at a swift pace, as evidenced by the current status of casino gambling among recreational activities in the united states. (4) today, the paramount public policy concern relative to gambling is the impact of the gambling industry itself on communities, states, and the nation as a whole. (5) gambling brings with it certain externalities that other industries do not bring. specifically, the proliferation of the gambling industry raises concerns regarding-- (a) corresponding proliferation of gambling addiction; (b) proliferation in addiction-related crime; (c) proliferation in cross addictions between gambling and alcohol and drugs; (d) decreases in worker productivity at the national level due to excessive gambling; (e) a potentially adverse impact on the health and viability of existing small businesses in communities where gambling is legalized and in communities surrounding indian reservations where gambling exists; (f) a competitive atmosphere developing between states and indian tribes, between states and other states, and between states and bordering countries, particularly canada, to attract the gambling dollar; and (g) dramatic growth in the political influence of gambling advocates in city halls and statehouses across the country, where governments must act as both regulator and profiteer of gambling. (6) there are variations and conflicts in the regulatory structures controlling gambling nation-wide, and in particular between federal oversight through the indian gaming regulatory act and state laws. (7) there is no adequate core or body of knowledge at the national level on the impact of gambling proliferation on the united states. (8) most of the economic impact studies of casino gambling have been sponsored by the gambling industry. (9) little funding has been made available at the state or federal level for research into gambling addiction and the socioeconomic cost to the nation of gambling addiction. (10) policymakers at the local, state, and federal levels are in need of sound information and data on the social and economic impact of gambling proliferation on the nation. sec. 2. establishment there is established a commission to be known as the ""commission on the review of national policies toward gambling"" (in this act referred to as the ""commission""). sec. 3 duties.
