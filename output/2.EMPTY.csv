(a) findings. --congress finds that-- (1) it is in the interest of the united states to maintain healthy livestock herds; (2) managing the risks of foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases in the united states may require billions of dollars for remedial activities by consumers, producers, and distributors of meat and blood products; (3) the potential introduction of those diseases into the united states would cause devastating financial losses to-- (a) the agriculture industry and other economic sectors; and (b) united states trade in the affected animals and animal products; (4) foot and mouth disease is a severe and highly contagious viral infection affecting cattle, deer, goats, sheep, swine, and other animals; (5) the most effective means of eradicating foot and mouth disease is by the slaughter of affected animals; (6) while foot and mouth disease was eradicated in the united states in 1929, the virus could be reintroduced by-- (a) a single infected animal, an animal product, or a person carrying the virus; (b) an act of terrorism;

(8) foot and mouth disease is endemic to more than \\\\2/3\\\\ of the world and is considered to be widespread in parts of africa, asia, europe, and south america; (9) foot and mouth disease occurs in over 7 different serotypes and 60 subtypes; (10) as foot and mouth disease outbreaks have occurred, the united states has banned the importation of live ruminants and swine and many animal products from countries affected by foot and mouth disease; (11) recently, the united states has implemented bans in response to outbreaks in argentina, the european union, and taiwan; (12) although united states exclusion programs have been successful at keeping foot and mouth disease out of the united states since 1929, recent outbreaks in argentina, the european union, and taiwan are placing an unprecedented strain on our animal health system;

(18) cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy originating from the united kingdom have been found and intercepted in canada; (19) since 1989, the secretary of agriculture has prohibited the importation of live grazing animals from countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy has been found in cattle; (20) other products derived from grazing animals, such as blood meal, bonemeal, fat, fetal bovine serum, glands, meat- and-bone meal, and offal, are prohibited from entry, except under special conditions or under permits issued by the secretary of agriculture for scientific or research purposes; (21) on december 12, 1997, the secretary of agriculture extended those restrictions to include all countries in europe because of concerns about widespread risk factors and inadequate surveillance for bovine spongiform encephalopathy; (22) on december 7, 2000, the secretary of agriculture prohibited all imports of rendered animal protein products from europe; (23) creutzfeldt-jacob disease is a human spongiform encephalopathy; (24) on march 20, 1996, the spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee of the united kingdom announced the identification of 10 cases of a new variant of creutzfeldt- jacob disease; (25) all 10 patients developed onsets of the disease in 1994 or 1995; (26) scientific experts (including scientists at the department of agriculture, the department of health and human services, and the world health organization) are studying the possible link (including potential routes of transmission) between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant creutzfeldt-jacob disease; (27) from october 1996 to december 2000, 87 cases of variant creutzfeldt-jacob disease have been reported in the united kingdom, 3 cases in france, and 1 case in ireland; and (28) to reduce the risk of human spongiform encephalopathies in the united states, the commissioner of food and drugs has-- (a) banned individuals who lived in great britain for at least 180 days since 1980 from donating blood in the united states;

3,204,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""federal repeal of expensive exchanges act"" or the ""free act"". sec. 2. findings. the congress finds the following: (1) the patient protection and affordable care act makes health care more expensive and less accessible, while also driving up the federal deficit and debt.

(3) the federal mandate to establish health insurance exchanges directly assaults the states' traditional authority to regulate health insurance. (4) such federal mandate imposes unknown insurance costs on consumers and administrative costs on states. (5) such federal mandate imposes a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach that ignores state differences.

(3) over 90 percent of the funds appropriated for the department of defense for operations in iraq and afghanistan have been provided as supplemental or additional appropriations and designated as an emergency funding requirement. (4) the congressional budget office and the congressional research service have stated that future costs for operations in iraq and afghanistan are difficult to estimate because the department of defense provides little information on costs incurred to date and does not report outlays or actual expenditure for operations in iraq and afghanistan (because war and baseline funds are mixed in the same accounts) and because of a lack of information from the department of defense on many of the key factors that determine costs, including personnel levels and the pace of operations. (5) over 2,000,000 members of the united states armed forces have served in afghanistan and iraq since the beginning of the conflicts.

6,329,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""african development foundation act of 2006"". sec. 2. findings. congress finds the following: (1) the african development foundation is uniquely promoting sustainable community-based solutions to economic and social development and is effectively supporting the development of african-owned small enterprises as engines of growth and sources of income and employment for the poor. (2) the african development foundation's programs advance united states interests in africa and are in high demand across the continent, as evidenced by $20 million in host country contributions. (3) the office of management and budget has determined the african development foundation to be a fully effective agency after assessing its program performance. (4) the african development foundation is the only united states government agency working directly at the grassroots level, supporting african-designed and african-driven solutions to economic and social problems. the african development foundation enables individuals and groups to get out of poverty by putting their own ideas to work, instead of someone else's. (5) in 2005, african development foundation investments across africa created more than 110,000 jobs for poor africans and generated $70 million in gross revenues for enterprises. almost 65 percent of micro and small entrepreneurs assisted by the african development foundation were women. (6) african development foundation-assisted groups had $35 million in export sales in 2005. for example, in tanzania, the african development foundation is helping several thousand small sugar cane producers improve their income. mtibwa sugar has increased its gross export revenues by 423 percent over the past three years, from us$1.188 million during fiscal year 2002 to us$5.034 million in fiscal year 2005. in the ruembe outgrowers association, sugar cane yields per hectare are up 30 percent and cumulative export sales stand at us$4.7 million. the number of participating cane farmers has increased by 50 percent since project inception and the income of the 1440 growers has almost doubled as a consequence of investment by the african development foundation. (7) the african development foundation is supporting african solutions to prevent hiv/aids and to reduce its impact on families and communities. for example, in swaziland, where almost 40 percent of adults are infected with the aids virus, the african development foundation is improving nutrition and providing income-generating opportunities for widows and orphans by helping them produce and market vegetables, in ghana, the african development foundation funded the training of almost 1500 youth who conducted peer counseling on hiv/aids to more than 200,000 young people, in plateau state, nigeria, the african development foundation funded a pilot program to adapt and extend a faith-based life skills training program in the public secondary schools in which approximately 500 teachers were trained in the new curriculum and more than 25,000 students received year-long training, and in tanzania, the african development foundation has experimented with supporting schemes that extend micro-credit to people living with hiv/aids, enabling them to start informal businesses and undertake income-generating activities.

(2) the steel and taconite iron mining industries have been severely impacted by the foreign dumping and overproduction of steel and are continually faced with unfair trade practices. (3) in 2014, united states imports of steel and steel products increased by 36 percent and captured 28 percent of the total united states steel market. in 2015, united states imports of steel and steel products continued to increase, and captured 29 percent of the total united states steel market. (4) in 1974, congress enacted the trade act of 1974 (19 u.s.c. 2101 et seq. ), which established the trade adjustment assistance program under chapter 2 of title ii of that act (19 u.s.c. 2271 et seq. ) to assist workers who have been adversely affected by trade. (5) the trade adjustment assistance program provides vital benefits and services to workers whose employment has been adversely affected by foreign trade. those benefits and services include education and training, income support, relocation assistance, job search assistance, and the health coverage tax credit. (6) since the inception of the trade adjustment assistance program, more than 5,000,000 united states workers have been certified as eligible for benefits and services under the program. (7) as of september 30, 2015, the trade adjustment assistance program had served more than 2,200,000 workers. (8) in fiscal year 2015, the department of labor certified 413 petitions for eligibility for the trade adjustment assistance program, which provided access to trade adjustment assistance benefits for 57,631 workers. (9) in 2015, more than 13,000 new participants were enrolled in the trade adjustment assistance for workers program and the program provided services and benefits to more than 47,000 workers.

13,886,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""preservation of access to osteoporosis testing for medicare beneficiaries act of 2011"". sec. 2. findings. congress finds the following: (1) since 1997, congress has recognized the importance of osteoporosis prevention by standardizing coverage under the medicare program for bone mass measurement. (2) osteoporosis remains underdiagnosed and undertreated despite numerous federal initiatives, including recommendations of the united states preventive services task force, the 2004 united states surgeon general's report on bone health and osteoporosis, and education, counseling, and referral for bone mass measurement during the welcome to medicare exam. (3) even though osteoporosis is a highly manageable disease, many patients lack access to early diagnosis that can prevent debilitating fractures, morbidity, and loss of mobility. (4) although caucasians are most likely to sustain osteoporosis fractures, from 2005 to 2025 the cost of fractures among other populations is projected to increase by 175 percent for latinos and asian-americans and 80 percent for african- americans. (5) african-american women are more likely than caucasian women to die following a hip fracture. (6) osteoporosis is a critical women's health issue. women account for 71 percent of fractures and 75 percent of osteoporosis-associated costs and the incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures is greater than the annual combined incidence, with respect to women, of heart attack, stroke, and breast cancer. (7) the world health organization, the centers for medicare & medicaid services, and other medical experts concur that the most widely accepted method of measuring bone mass to predict fracture risk is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (in this section referred to as ""dxa""). vertebral fracture assessment (in this section referred to as ""vfa"") is another test used to identify patients at high risk for future fracture. (8) dxa is a cost-effective preventive test with proven results in real world settings. dxa testing increases the number of people diagnosed with osteoporosis and treated, dramatically reducing hip fractures and related costs. (9) dxa screening is associated with a significant (37 percent) reduction in hip fracture rates. (10) unlike other imaging procedures, dxa remains severely underutilized, with only one in four women enrolled in the medicare program getting a dxa every two years. (11) underutilization of bone mass measurement will strain the medicare budget because-- (a) over half of all individuals in the united states who are age 50 or older have osteoporosis or low bone mass; (b) more than 52.4 million people in the united states had osteoporosis or low bone mass in 2010, as compared to 44 million people in the united states in 2002; (c) osteoporosis fractures are projected to increase by almost 50 percent from 2005 to 2025 with over 3 million fractures expected to occur annually by 2025; (d) the population aged 65 and older represents 89 percent of fracture costs; and (e) the economic burden of osteoporosis fractures is projected to increase by nearly 50 percent from 2005 to 2025, reaching 25.3 million in 2025. (12) underutilization of bone mass measurement will also strain the medicaid budget, which bears the cost of nursing home admissions for hip fractures for low-income americans. (13) reimbursement under the medicare program for dxa provided in physician offices and other non-hospital settings was reduced by 50 percent and is scheduled to be reduced by a total of 62 percent by 2013. this drop represents one of the largest reimbursement reductions in the history of the medicare program. reimbursement for vfa will also be reduced by 30 percent by 2013. (14) the reduction in reimbursement discourages physicians from continuing to provide access to dxa or vfa in their offices. dxa testing for older women declined in 2009 for the first time since congress passed the bone mass measurement act in 1997. since two-thirds of all dxa scans are performed in non-facility settings, such as physician offices, patient access to bone mass measurement will continue to be severely compromised when more physicians discontinue providing such tests in their offices, thereby exacerbating the current underutilization of the benefit. sec. 3. extending minimum payment for bone mass measurement. (a) in general. --section 1848 of the social security act (42 u.s.c. 1395w-4) is amended-- (1) in subsection (b)-- (a) in paragraph (4) (b), by striking ""for 2010 and 2011"" and inserting ""for each of 2010 through 2013""; and (b) in paragraph (6)-- (i) in the matter preceding subparagraph (a), by striking ""and 2011"" and inserting "", 2011, 2012, and 2013""; and (ii) in subparagraph (c), by striking ""and 2011"" and inserting "", 2011, 2012, and 2013""; and (2) in subsection (c)(2) (b)(iv)(iv), by striking ""or 2011"" and inserting "", 2011, 2012, or 2013"".

(1) the department of defense, in its 2011 report to congress on ""military and security developments involving the people's republic of china,"" found that ""china continued modernizing its military in 2010, with a focus on taiwan contingencies, even as cross-strait relations improved. the pla seeks the capability to deter taiwan independence and influence taiwan to settle the dispute on beijing's terms. in pursuit of this objective, beijing is developing capabilities intended to deter, delay, or deny possible u.s. support for the island in the event of conflict. the balance of cross-strait military forces and capabilities continues to shift in the mainland's favor. "" in this report, the department of defense also concludes that, over the next decade, china's air force will remain primarily focused on ""building the capabilities required to pose a credible military threat to taiwan and u.s. forces in east asia, deter taiwan independence, or influence taiwan to settle the dispute on beijing's terms"". (2) the defense intelligence agency (dia) conducted a preliminary assessment of the status and capabilities of taiwan's air force in an unclassified report, dated january 21, 2010. the dia found that, ""[a]lthough taiwan has nearly 400 combat aircraft in service, far fewer of these are operationally capable. "" the report concluded, ""many of taiwan's fighter aircraft are close to or beyond service life, and many require extensive maintenance support. the retirement of mirage and f-5 aircraft will reduce the total size of the taiwan air force. "" (3) since 2006, authorities from taiwan have made repeated requests to purchase 66 f-16c/d multirole fighter aircraft from the united states, in an effort to modernize the air force of taiwan and maintain its self-defense capability. (4) according to a report by the perryman group, a private economic research and analysis firm, the requested sale of f- 16c/ds to taiwan ""would generate some $8,700,000,000 in output (gross product) and more than 87,664 person-years of employment in the us,"" including 23,407 direct jobs, while ""economic benefits would likely be realized in 44 states and the district of columbia"". (5) the sale of f-16c/ds to taiwan would both sustain existing high-skilled jobs in key united states manufacturing sectors and create new ones. (6) on august 1, 2011, a bipartisan group of 181 members of the house of representatives sent a letter to the president, expressing support for the sale of f-16c/ds to taiwan. on may 26, 2011, a bipartisan group of 45 members of the senate sent a similar letter to the president, expressing support for the sale. two other members of the senate wrote separately to the president or the secretary of state in 2011 and expressed support for this sale. sec. 3. sense of congress. it is the sense of congress that-- (1) a critical element to maintaining peace and stability in asia in the face of china's two-decade-long program of military modernization and expansion of military capabilities is ensuring a militarily strong and confident taiwan; (2) a taiwan that is confident in its ability to deter chinese aggression will increase its ability to proceed in developing peaceful relations with china in areas of mutual interest; (3) the cross-strait military balance between china and our longstanding strategic partner, taiwan, has clearly shifted in china's favor; (4) china's military expansion poses a clear and present danger to taiwan, and this threat has very serious implications for the ability of the united states to fulfill its security obligations to allies in the region and protect our vital united states national interests in east asia; (5) taiwan's air force continues to deteriorate, and it needs additional advanced multirole fighter aircraft in order to modernize its fleet and maintain a sufficient self-defense capability; (6) the united states has a statutory obligation under the taiwan relations act (22 u.s.c. 3301 et seq.) to provide taiwan the defense articles necessary to enable taiwan to maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities, in furtherance of maintaining peace and stability in the western pacific region; (7) in order to comply with the taiwan relations act, the united states must provide taiwan with additional advanced multirole fighter aircraft, as well as significant upgrades to taiwan's existing fleet of multirole fighter aircraft; and (8) the proposed sale of f-16c/d multirole fighter aircraft to taiwan would have significant economic benefits to the united states economy. sec. 4. sale of f-16 aircraft to taiwan. the president shall carry out the sale of no fewer than 66 f-16c/d multirole fighter aircraft to taiwan. the president shall carry out the sale of no fewer than 66 f-16c/d multirole fighter aircraft to taiwan."," Taiwan Air Power Modernization Act of 2011 - Expresses the sense of Congress that: (1) a critical element to maintaining peace and stability in Asia in the face of China's military expansion is ensuring a militarily strong Taiwan, (2) the United States has a statutory obligation under the Taiwan Relations Act to help Taiwan maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities, and (3) the proposed fighter aircraft sale to Taiwan would have significant economic benefits to the U.S. economy.

24,1451,"section 1. findings. the congress finds as follows: (1) the over reliance of the united states on imported petroleum creates a major strategic vulnerability for the nation, with nearly half of the energy supply of the united states dependent on foreign sources. (2) from the economically damaging arab oil embargoes of 1973-74 and 1979 to the recession precipitated by rising oil prices which began in 1999, to the stock market's instability in early 2005 due to the cost of imported oil at near record highs of $55 per barrel, the economic stability of the united states has too often been shaken by economic forces outside its borders. (3) increasing fuel prices have been a particular hardship on small, independent businesses particularly truckers and farmers, who have no choice but to pay ever-increasing fuel bills while absorbing these higher costs in today's economic environment. (4) this act would help shift america's dependence away from foreign petroleum as an energy source toward alternative, renewable, domestic agricultural sources. its aim is to convert the current petroleum trade deficit to a trade balance by replacing foreign sources of supply with steady increases of biobased fuels through domestic production. (5) today, there are nearly 140,000,000 cars and 85,000,000 trucks on our highways. of this amount, approximately 3,300,000 cars and trucks already on our highways will run on 85 percent ethanol (e-85), and this number is increasing. for the 2005 model year, there are 20 different models of vehicles capable of running on e-85. yet given this market, the alternative fuel is used less than 1 percent of the time given that of the more than 187,000 retail locations selling motor fuel in the united states, only 400 stations across 38 states sell e-85. (6) biodiesel production is also dramatically increasing, going from 5,000,000 gallons in 2001 to nearly 25,000,000 gallons in 2003. daimler-chrysler has also announced its intentions to initially fuel the diesel jeep liberty with a 5 percent biodiesel blend, the first time a vehicle has been explicitly fueled with an alternative fuel as it rolls off the production line. (7) currently the united states annually consumes about 7,171,885,000 barrels of petroleum. (164,000,000,000 gallons of vehicle fuels and 5,600,00,000 gallons of heating oil. ) in 2002, 62 percent of these fuels were imported, part of a total $358,200,000,000 trade deficit with the rest of the world. since 1983, the united states importation of petroleum and its derivatives has more than tripled, rising from 1,215,225,000 barrels in 1983 to 4,476,501,000 barrels in 2003. (8) further strategic petroleum reserve policy should encourage domestic production to the greatest extent possible. currently, the strategic petroleum reserve holds 670,700,000 barrels (out of a potential 727,000,000 barrels), sufficient to cushion the united states from wild price swings for a period of 53 days. none of the fuel in this reserve is bio-based. in fact, 92.2 percent of the strategic petroleum reserve has been purchased from foreign sources--41.9 percent from mexico, 24 percent from the united kingdom, and over 20 percent from opec nations. (9) strategic petroleum reserve policy also should encourage the development of alternatives to the nation's reliance on petroleum such as biomass fuels. (10) as a first step in diversification, the strategic petroleum reserve should exchange 2,100,000 barrels from our current reserves for 32,000,000 gallons of ethanol and biodiesel, which could comprise less than 2 percent of the united states market, but yield a doubling of ethanol products. (11) the benefits of biofuels are as follows: (a) energy security. -- (i) biofuels hold potential to address our dependence on foreign energy sources immediately. with agricultural surpluses, commodity prices have reached record lows; concurrently world petroleum prices have reached record highs and are expected to continue rising as global petroleum reserves are drawn down over the next 25 years. it also is clear that economic conditions are favorable to utilize domestic surpluses of biobased oils to enhance the nation's energy security. (ii) in the short term, biofuels can supply at least one-fifth of current united states fuel demand using existing technologies and capabilities. additional plant research, newer processing and distribution technologies, and placing additional acres under cultivation can yield even greater results. (iii) biofuels can be used with existing petroleum infrastructure and conventional equipment. (b) economic security. -- (i) continued dependence upon imported sources of oil means our nation is strategically vulnerable to disruptions in our oil supply. (ii) renewable biofuels domestically produced directly replace imported oil. (iii) increased use of renewable biofuels would result in significant economic benefits to rural and urban areas and also reduce the trade deficit. (iv) according to the department of agriculture, a sustained annual market of 100,000,000 gallons of biodiesel alone would result in $170,000,000 in increased income to farmers. (v) farmer-owned biofuels production has already resulted in improved income for farmers, as evidenced by the experience with state-supported rural development efforts in minnesota where prices to corn producers have been increased by $1.00 per bushel. with the department of agriculture having forecast prices of $2.10 per bushel of corn for the 2004-2005 marketing year, the portion of the corn crop that goes for ethanol has a farm value of $2,100,000,000. (c) environmental security. -- (i) the use of grain-based ethanol reduces greenhouse gas emissions from 35 to 46 percent compared with conventional gasoline. biomass ethanol provides an even greater reduction. (ii) the american lung association of metropolitan chicago credits ethanol-blended reformulated gasoline with reducing smog- forming emissions by 25 percent since 1990. (iii) ethanol reduces tailpipe carbon monoxide emissions by as much as 30 percent. (iv) ethanol reduces exhaust volatile organic compounds emissions by 12 percent. (v) ethanol reduces toxic emissions by 30 percent. (vi) ethanol reduces particulate emissions, especially fine-particulates that pose a health threat to children, senior citizens, and those with respiratory ailments. (vii) biodiesel contains no sulfur or aromatics associated with air pollution. (viii) the use of biodiesel provides a 78.5 percent reduction in co2 emissions compared to petroleum diesel and when burned in a conventional engine provides a substantial reduction of unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. sec. 2. ethanol and biodiesel fuel requirements. section 211 of the clean air act (42 u.s.c. 7545) is amended as follows: (1) by redesignating subsection (o) as subsection (q). (2) by inserting after subsection (n) the following: "" (o) renewable fuel program-- ""(1) definitions. --in this section: "" (a) ethanol. --the term 'ethanol' means ethanol derived from any lignocellulosic or hemicellulosic matter that is available on a renewable or recurring basis, including dedicated energy crops and trees, wood and wood residues, plants, grasses, agricultural residues, and fibers. the term includes ethanol derived from animal wastes, including poultry fats and poultry wastes, and other waste materials, or municipal solid waste.

(2) extending approximately 105 miles from orlando to lake okeechobee, the kissimmee river forms the headwaters of lake okeechobee and the everglades and serves as a vital component of ecosystem restoration in south florida as a whole. (3) the kissimmee river restoration project has significantly improved approximately 63,000 acres of wetlands within the kissimmee river watershed and reestablished an environment suitable for fish, wildlife, and the wetland plants that existed prior to the kissimmee river's channelization in the 1960s. (4) the kissimmee river restoration project is expected to be completed in 2020, at which point it is expected to reestablish historic hydrologic conditions, recreate historic river and floodplain connectivity, recreate the historic mosaic of wetland plant communities, and restore historic biological diversity and functionality. (5) after decades of restoration efforts and the expenditure of nearly a billion dollars, upon completion of the kissimmee river restoration project, a study should be conducted to determine the eligibility of including the fully restored kissimmee river into the national wild and scenic river program to preserve the fully restored free-flowing condition and immediate environment of the river for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations.

32,2073,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""autism understanding and training in school methodologies for educators act of 2012"". sec. 2. findings. the congress finds as follows: (1) autism is a group of complex developmental brain disorders collectively referred to as autism spectrum disorders (asds) that can cause a wide range of symptoms, skills, and levels of impairment including social, communication and behavior changes. (2) autism spectrum disorders are also referred to as pervasive developmental disorders and include subcategories of classic autism with ranges from high functioning autism (hfa) to low functioning autism, asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (pdd-nos), as well as more severe cases of rhett syndrome and child disintegrative disorder. (3) autism affects an estimated 1 in 88 children by age 8 and 1 in 54 boys. (4) an estimated 1,500,000 individuals in the united states are affected by autism. (5) more children will be diagnosed with autism this year than with aids, diabetes, and cancer combined. (6) autism is the fastest growing serious developmental disability in the united states. (7) autism costs the nation over $35,000,000,000 per year, a figure expected to significantly increase in the next decade. (8) boys are five times more likely than girls to have autism. (9) there is currently no medical cure for autism, but there are evidence-based educational methods proven to be effective in improving outcomes for students with autism and research demonstrating the benefits of routine and consistency. (10) the least restrictive environment for educating students with autism spectrum disorder, including, but not limited to, students with high functioning autism, asperger syndrome, and pdd-nos, often is best achieved by enrollment in a general education classroom with proper support. (11) general education classroom teachers and staff often are not adequately trained to work effectively with students with autism spectrum disorders, who have a wide diversity of characteristics, although such skills may be attained through qualified training programs and may be relatively easy to implement in school settings. (12) training general education classroom teachers and staff to implement evidence-based practices for educating students with autism spectrum disorders with accuracy and fidelity will help provide for best possible outcomes not only for students with autism, but also for other students in the classroom. (13) children with autism in highly transient families, such as the military (where the rate of children on the spectrum is even higher) and foreign service families, often face additional challenges in the public education system because of frequent changes in the family's geographic duty station or a parent's deployment, which can interrupt the provision of appropriate interventions and continuity of effective educational methods. (14) in school districts that have a large population of transient families or that border military bases it is especially important to have staff who are highly trained to provide effective services and build a proven track record of academic achievement in serving students with autism. sec. 3. demonstration program authorized. (a) authorization of grant program. --the secretary is authorized to carry out a demonstration grant program to award grants to eligible entities to enable such entities to accomplish the purposes described in subsection (b).

(2) providing technical assistance consisting of consultation on the type of training needed, hands-on opportunities to practice and perform newly acquired skills and methodologies with fidelity, and post-training support to ensure accuracy of implementation in the classroom.

34,2254,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""telework tax incentive act"". sec. 2. findings. the congress finds as follows: (1) federal, state, and local governments spend billions of dollars annually on the nation's transportation needs. (2) congestion on the nation's roads costs over $74,000,000,000 annually in lost work time, fuel consumption, and costs of infrastructure and equipment repair. (3) on average on-road-vehicles contribute 30 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions. (4) it is estimated that staying at home to work requires 3 times less energy consumption than commuting to work. (5) it was recently reported that if an identified 10 to 20 percent of commuters switched to teleworking, 1,800,000 tons of regulated pollutants would be eliminated, 3,500,000,000 gallons of gas would be saved, 3,100,000,000 hours of personal time would be freed up, and maintenance and infrastructure costs would decrease by $500,000,000 annually because of reduced congestion and reduced vehicle miles traveled. (6) the average american daily commute is 62 minutes for a 44-mile round-trip (a total of 6 days per year and 5,808 miles per year). (7) the increase in work from 1969 to 1996, the increase in hours mothers spend in paid work, combined with a shift toward single-parent families resulted in families on average experiencing a decrease of 22 hours a week (14 percent) in parental time available outside of paid work they could spend with their children. (8) companies with teleworking programs have found that teleworking can boost employee productivity 5 percent to 20 percent. (9) today 60 percent of the workforce is involved in information work (an increase of 43 percent since 1990) allowing and encouraging decentralization of paid work to occur. (10) in recent years, studies performed in the united states have shown a marked expansion of teleworking, with an estimate of 19,000,000 americans teleworking by the year 2002, 5 times the amount in 1990. sec. 3. credit for teleworking. (a) in general. --subpart b of part iv of subchapter a of chapter 1 of the internal revenue code of 1986 (relating to foreign tax credit, etc.) is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ""sec. 30b. teleworking credit. "" (a) allowance of credit. --in the case of an eligible taxpayer, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year an amount equal to the qualified teleworking expenses paid or incurred by the taxpayer during such year. "" (b) maximum credit. -- ""(1) per teleworker limitation. --the credit allowed by subsection (a) for a taxable year with respect to qualified teleworking expenses paid or incurred by or on behalf of an individual teleworker shall not exceed $500. ""(2) reduction for teleworking less than full year. --in the case of an individual who is in a teleworking arrangement for less than a full taxable year, the amount referred to paragraph (1) shall be reduced by an amount which bears the same ratio to $500 as the number of months in which such individual is not in a teleworking arrangement bears to 12. for purposes of the preceding sentence, an individual shall be treated as being in a teleworking arrangement for a month if the individual is subject to such arrangement for any day of such month. "" (c) definitions. --for purposes of this section-- ""(1) eligible taxpayer. --the term 'eligible taxpayer' means-- "" (a) in the case of an individual, an individual who performs services for an employer under a teleworking arrangement, and "" (b) in the case of an employer, an employer for whom employees perform services under a teleworking arrangement. ""(2) teleworking arrangement. --the term 'teleworking arrangement' means an arrangement under which an employee teleworks for an employer not less than 75 days per year. ""(3) qualified teleworking expenses. --the term 'qualified teleworking expenses' means expenses paid or incurred under a teleworking arrangement for furnishings and electronic information equipment which are used to enable an individual to telework. ""(4) telework. --the term 'telework' means to perform work functions, using electronic information and communication technologies, thereby reducing or eliminating the physical commute to and from the traditional worksite. "" (d) limitation based on amount of tax. -- ""(1) liability for tax. --the credit allowable under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) of-- "" (a) the regular tax for the taxable year, reduced by the sum of the credits allowable under subpart a and the preceding sections of this subpart, over "" (b) the tentative minimum tax for the taxable year. ""(2) carryforward of unused credit. --if the amount of the credit allowable under subsection (a) for any taxable year exceeds the limitation under paragraph (1) for the taxable year, the excess shall be carried to the succeeding taxable year and added to the amount allowable as a credit under subsection (a) for such succeeding taxable year. ""(e) special rules. -- ""(1) basis reduction. --the basis of any property for which a credit is allowable under subsection (a) shall be reduced by the amount of such credit (determined without regard to subsection (d)).

42,3216,"section 1. findings. congress finds the following: (1) armed conflicts in the middle east have created refugee populations numbering in the millions and comprised of peoples from many ethnic, religious, and national backgrounds. (2) jews have lived mostly as a minority in the middle east, north africa, and the persian gulf region for more than 2,500 years. (3) the united states has long voiced its concern about the mistreatment of minorities and the violation of human rights in the middle east and elsewhere. (4) the united states continues to play a pivotal role in seeking an end to the arab-israeli conflict in the middle east and to promoting a peace that will benefit all the peoples of the region. (5) united states administrations historically have called for a just solution to the palestinian refugee problem. (6) the palestinian refugee issue has received considerable attention from countries of the world while the issue of jewish refugees from the arab and muslim worlds has received very little attention. (7) a comprehensive peace in the region will require the resolution of all outstanding issues through bilateral and multilateral negotiations involving all concerned parties. (8) approximately 850,000 jews were displaced from arab countries since the declaration of the state of israel in 1948. (9) the united states has demonstrated interest and concern about the mistreatment, violation of rights, forced expulsion, and expropriation of assets of minority populations in general, and, in particular, former jewish refugees displaced from arab countries as evidenced, inter alia, by-- (a) the memorandum of understanding signed by president jimmy carter and israeli foreign minister moshe dayan on october 4, 1977, which states that ""[a] solution of the problem of arab refugees and jewish refugees will be discussed in accordance with rules which should be agreed""; (b) after negotiating the camp david accords, the framework for peace in the middle east, the statement by president jimmy carter in a press conference on october 27, 1977, that ""palestinians have rights . . . obviously there are jewish refugees . . . they have the same rights as others do""; and (c) in an interview after camp david ii in july 2000, at which the issue of jewish refugees displaced from arab lands was discussed, the statement by president clinton that ""there will have to be some sort of international fund set up for the refugees. there is, i think, some interest, interestingly enough, on both sides, in also having a fund which compensates the israelis who were made refugees by the war, which occurred after the birth of the state of israel. israel is full of people, jewish people, who lived in predominantly arab countries who came to israel because they were made refugees in their own land. "". (10) on april 1, 2008, the house of representatives passed house resolution 185, expressing the sense of the house of representatives that-- (a) for any comprehensive middle east peace agreement to be credible and enduring, the agreement must address and resolve all outstanding issues relating to the legitimate rights of all refugees, including jews, christians, and other populations, displaced from countries in the middle east; and (b) the president should instruct the united states representative to the united nations and all united states representatives in bilateral and multilateral fora to-- (i) use the voice, vote, and influence of the united states to ensure that any resolutions relating to the issue of middle east refugees, and which include a reference to the required resolution of the palestinian refugee issue, must also include a similarly explicit reference to the resolution of the issue of jewish refugees from arab countries; and (ii) make clear that the united states government supports the position that, as an integral part of any comprehensive arab-israeli peace, the issue of refugees from the middle east, north africa, and the persian gulf must be resolved in a manner that includes recognition of the legitimate rights of and losses incurred by all refugees displaced from arab countries, including jews, christians, and other groups. (11) the international definition of a refugee clearly applies to jews who fled the persecution of arab regimes, where a refugee is a person who ""owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country"" (the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees). (12) on january 29, 1957, the united nations high commissioner for refugees (unhcr), determined that jews fleeing from arab countries were refugees who fell within the mandate of the unhcr. (13) subsequently, in a second unhcr declaration, dr. e. jahn of the office of the united nations high commissioner stated, on july 6, 1967: ""i refer to our recent discussion concerning jews from middle eastern and north african countries in consequence of recent events. i am now able to inform you that such persons may be considered prima facie within the mandate of this office. "". (14) united nations security council resolution 242 of november 22, 1967, calls for a ""just settlement of the refugee problem"" without distinction between palestinian and jewish refugees, and this is evidenced by the following: (a) on november 16, 1967, the united kingdom submitted a draft of resolution 242 (s/8247) to the united nations security council. this united kingdom draft called for a just settlement of ""the refugee problem"". the soviet union submitted its own draft of resolution 242 (s/8253) to the united nations security council four days later which restricted the just settlement to only ""palestinian refugees"". (b) on november 22, 1967, the united nations security council unanimously approved the draft of resolution 242 advanced by the united kingdom. it thus rejected the limitation proposed by the soviet union and accepted the broader notion of a ""just settlement of the refugee problem"" arising out of the middle east conflict to include palestinian and jewish refugees. (c) justice arthur goldberg, the united states chief delegate to the united nations at that time, who was instrumental in drafting the unanimously adopted resolution 242, pointed out that ""the resolution addresses the objective of 'achieving a just settlement of the refugee problem'. this language presumably refers both to arab and jewish refugees, for about an equal number of each abandoned their homes as a result of the several wars. "". (15) in his opening remarks before the january 28, 1992, organizational meeting for multilateral negotiations on the middle east in moscow, united states secretary of state james baker made no distinction between palestinian refugees and jewish refugees in articulating the mission of the refugee working group, stating that ""[t]he refugee group will consider practical ways of improving the lot of people throughout the region who have been displaced from their homes"". (16) the roadmap to a permanent two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict, which refers in phase iii to an ""agreed, just, fair, and realistic solution to the refugee issue"", uses language that is equally applicable to all persons displaced as a result of the conflict in the middle east. (17) israel's agreements with egypt, jordan, and the palestinians have affirmed that a comprehensive solution to the arab-israeli conflict will require a just solution to the plight of all refugees. (18) israel's long-standing position in support of the rights and claims of jewish refugees from arab countries and iran is well-established: (a) on september 28, 1969, israel adopted government decision number 34, in which it set up a special, temporary department in the ministry of justice to gather facts and evidence regarding property expropriated and persecution perpetrated on jews in egypt, iraq, syria, and yemen. (b) on march 3, 2002, israel adopted government decision number 1544, in which it reaffirmed government decision number 34 and expanded it to include jews who left all arab countries and iran. (c) on december 28, 2003, israel adopted government decision number 1250, in which it reaffirmed government decisions number 34 and 1544 and directed the department for the rights of jews from arab countries in the ministry of justice to continue collecting information on property expropriated and persecution perpetrated on jews in arab countries, create a centralized database of this information, and publish this information to encourage parties to come forward. (19) recently, in february 2010, the israeli knesset adopted a law preserving the rights for compensation for jewish refugees who originated from arab countries and iran. according to this law, the israeli government and its prime minister are instructed to raise the issue of compensation for private and communal property during negotiations. (20) the initiative to secure rights and redress for jews who were forced to flee arab countries does not conflict with the right of palestinian refugees to claim redress. (21) all countries should be aware of the plight of jews and other minority groups displaced from countries in the middle east, north africa, and the persian gulf. (22) an international campaign has been proceeding in some 20 countries to record the history and legacy of jewish refugees from arab countries. (23) a just, comprehensive arab-israeli peace cannot be reached without addressing the uprooting of centuries-old jewish communities in the middle east, north africa, and the persian gulf. (24) it would be inappropriate and unjust for the united states to recognize rights for palestinian refugees without recognizing equal rights for jewish refugees from arab countries. sec. 2. report. not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this act, and every two years thereafter, the president shall submit to congress a report on the following: (1) actions the executive branch has taken to fulfill the sense of the house of representatives, as contained in paragraph (2) of the first section of house resolution 185 (as passed the house of representatives on april 1, 2008) and described in section 1(10) (b) of this act. (2) actions the executive branch has taken to use the voice, vote, and influence of the united states to ensure that any statements that include a reference to the required resolution of the palestinian refugee issue by the quartet on the middle east, which includes the united nations, the united states, the european union, and russia, must also include a similarly explicit reference to the resolution of the issue of jewish refugees from arab countries. (3) assistance the united states has provided to israel to help it accomplish its goal that the interests of jews displaced from arab countries are considered in any final settlement of the middle east refugee question that is part of any comprehensive arab-israeli peace. (4) recommended actions that would ensure that the interests of all refugees displaced from arab countries, including jews, christians, and other groups, are considered in any final settlement of the middle east refugee question that is part of any comprehensive arab-israeli peace. is part of any comprehensive arab-israeli peace."," Directs the President to report to Congress every two years regarding executive branch actions taken to ensure that the interests of all refugees displaced from Arab countries, including Jews, Christians, and other groups, are considered in any final settlement of the Middle East refugee question that is part of any comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace.",
