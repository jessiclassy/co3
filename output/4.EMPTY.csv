0,204,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""federal repeal of expensive exchanges act"" or the ""free act"". sec. 2. findings. the congress finds the following: (1) the patient protection and affordable care act makes health care more expensive and less accessible, while also driving up the federal deficit and debt. (2) this increase in cost is most noticeable in the health insurance exchanges established under such act, which would increase the federal deficit by $1.017 trillion over an eleven- year timeframe, as stated in a july, 2012 congressional budget office report. (3) the federal mandate to establish health insurance exchanges directly assaults the states' traditional authority to regulate health insurance. (4) such federal mandate imposes unknown insurance costs on consumers and administrative costs on states. (5) such federal mandate imposes a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach that ignores state differences.

2,329,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""african development foundation act of 2006"". sec. 2. findings. congress finds the following: (1) the african development foundation is uniquely promoting sustainable community-based solutions to economic and social development and is effectively supporting the development of african-owned small enterprises as engines of growth and sources of income and employment for the poor. (2) the african development foundation's programs advance united states interests in africa and are in high demand across the continent, as evidenced by $20 million in host country contributions. (3) the office of management and budget has determined the african development foundation to be a fully effective agency after assessing its program performance. (4) the african development foundation is the only united states government agency working directly at the grassroots level, supporting african-designed and african-driven solutions to economic and social problems. the african development foundation enables individuals and groups to get out of poverty by putting their own ideas to work, instead of someone else's. (5) in 2005, african development foundation investments across africa created more than 110,000 jobs for poor africans and generated $70 million in gross revenues for enterprises. almost 65 percent of micro and small entrepreneurs assisted by the african development foundation were women. (6) african development foundation-assisted groups had $35 million in export sales in 2005. for example, in tanzania, the african development foundation is helping several thousand small sugar cane producers improve their income. mtibwa sugar has increased its gross export revenues by 423 percent over the past three years, from us$1.188 million during fiscal year 2002 to us$5.034 million in fiscal year 2005. in the ruembe outgrowers association, sugar cane yields per hectare are up 30 percent and cumulative export sales stand at us$4.7 million. the number of participating cane farmers has increased by 50 percent since project inception and the income of the 1440 growers has almost doubled as a consequence of investment by the african development foundation. (7) the african development foundation is supporting african solutions to prevent hiv/aids and to reduce its impact on families and communities. for example, in swaziland, where almost 40 percent of adults are infected with the aids virus, the african development foundation is improving nutrition and providing income-generating opportunities for widows and orphans by helping them produce and market vegetables, in ghana, the african development foundation funded the training of almost 1500 youth who conducted peer counseling on hiv/aids to more than 200,000 young people, in plateau state, nigeria, the african development foundation funded a pilot program to adapt and extend a faith-based life skills training program in the public secondary schools in which approximately 500 teachers were trained in the new curriculum and more than 25,000 students received year-long training, and in tanzania, the african development foundation has experimented with supporting schemes that extend micro-credit to people living with hiv/aids, enabling them to start informal businesses and undertake income-generating activities. (8) the work of the african development foundation is a powerful example of the goodwill of the american people, and it is one of the most effective foreign assistance programs of the united states. sec. 3. amendments to african development foundation act.

4,782,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""child care quality incentive act of 1999"". sec. 2. findings and purposes. (a) findings. --congress makes the following findings: (1) recent research on early brain development reveals that much of a child's growth is determined by early learning and nurturing care. research also shows that quality early care and education leads to increased cognitive abilities, positive classroom learning behavior, increased likelihood of long-term school success, and greater likelihood of long-term economic and social self-sufficiency. (2) each day an estimated 13,000,000 children, including 6,000,000 infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day in child care. however, a study in 4 states found that only 1 in 7 child care centers provide care that promotes healthy development, while 1 in 8 child care centers provide care that threatens the safety and health of children. (3) full-day child care can cost $4,000 to $10,000 per year. (4) although federal assistance is available for child care, funding is severely limited. even with federal subsidies, many families cannot afford child care. for families with young children and a monthly income under $1,200, the cost of child care typically consumes 25 percent of their income. (5) payment (or reimbursement) rates, the maximum the state will reimburse a child care provider for the care of a child who receives a subsidy, are too low to ensure that quality care is accessible to all families. (6) low payment rates directly affect the kind of care children get and whether families can find quality child care in their communities. in many instances, low payment rates force child care providers to cut corners in ways that lower the quality of care for children, including reducing number of staff, eliminating staff training opportunities, and cutting enriching educational activities and services. (7) children in low quality child care are more likely to have delayed reading and language skills, and display more aggression toward other children and adults. (8) increased payment rates lead to higher quality child care as child care providers are able to attract and retain qualified staff, provide salary increases and professional training, maintain a safe and healthy environment, and purchase basic supplies and developmentally appropriate educational materials.

5,886,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""preservation of access to osteoporosis testing for medicare beneficiaries act of 2011"". sec. 2. findings. congress finds the following: (1) since 1997, congress has recognized the importance of osteoporosis prevention by standardizing coverage under the medicare program for bone mass measurement. (2) osteoporosis remains underdiagnosed and undertreated despite numerous federal initiatives, including recommendations of the united states preventive services task force, the 2004 united states surgeon general's report on bone health and osteoporosis, and education, counseling, and referral for bone mass measurement during the welcome to medicare exam. (3) even though osteoporosis is a highly manageable disease, many patients lack access to early diagnosis that can prevent debilitating fractures, morbidity, and loss of mobility. (4) although caucasians are most likely to sustain osteoporosis fractures, from 2005 to 2025 the cost of fractures among other populations is projected to increase by 175 percent for latinos and asian-americans and 80 percent for african- americans. (5) african-american women are more likely than caucasian women to die following a hip fracture. (6) osteoporosis is a critical women's health issue. women account for 71 percent of fractures and 75 percent of osteoporosis-associated costs and the incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures is greater than the annual combined incidence, with respect to women, of heart attack, stroke, and breast cancer. (7) the world health organization, the centers for medicare & medicaid services, and other medical experts concur that the most widely accepted method of measuring bone mass to predict fracture risk is dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (in this section referred to as ""dxa""). vertebral fracture assessment (in this section referred to as ""vfa"") is another test used to identify patients at high risk for future fracture. (8) dxa is a cost-effective preventive test with proven results in real world settings. dxa testing increases the number of people diagnosed with osteoporosis and treated, dramatically reducing hip fractures and related costs. (9) dxa screening is associated with a significant (37 percent) reduction in hip fracture rates. (10) unlike other imaging procedures, dxa remains severely underutilized, with only one in four women enrolled in the medicare program getting a dxa every two years. (11) underutilization of bone mass measurement will strain the medicare budget because-- (a) over half of all individuals in the united states who are age 50 or older have osteoporosis or low bone mass; (b) more than 52.4 million people in the united states had osteoporosis or low bone mass in 2010, as compared to 44 million people in the united states in 2002; (c) osteoporosis fractures are projected to increase by almost 50 percent from 2005 to 2025 with over 3 million fractures expected to occur annually by 2025; (d) the population aged 65 and older represents 89 percent of fracture costs; and (e) the economic burden of osteoporosis fractures is projected to increase by nearly 50 percent from 2005 to 2025, reaching 25.3 million in 2025. (12) underutilization of bone mass measurement will also strain the medicaid budget, which bears the cost of nursing home admissions for hip fractures for low-income americans. (13) reimbursement under the medicare program for dxa provided in physician offices and other non-hospital settings was reduced by 50 percent and is scheduled to be reduced by a total of 62 percent by 2013. this drop represents one of the largest reimbursement reductions in the history of the medicare program. reimbursement for vfa will also be reduced by 30 percent by 2013. (14) the reduction in reimbursement discourages physicians from continuing to provide access to dxa or vfa in their offices. dxa testing for older women declined in 2009 for the first time since congress passed the bone mass measurement act in 1997. since two-thirds of all dxa scans are performed in non-facility settings, such as physician offices, patient access to bone mass measurement will continue to be severely compromised when more physicians discontinue providing such tests in their offices, thereby exacerbating the current underutilization of the benefit. sec. 3. extending minimum payment for bone mass measurement. (a) in general. --section 1848 of the social security act (42 u.s.c. 1395w-4) is amended-- (1) in subsection (b)-- (a) in paragraph (4) (b), by striking ""for 2010 and 2011"" and inserting ""for each of 2010 through 2013""; and (b) in paragraph (6)-- (i) in the matter preceding subparagraph (a), by striking ""and 2011"" and inserting "", 2011, 2012, and 2013""; and (ii) in subparagraph (c), by striking ""and 2011"" and inserting "", 2011, 2012, and 2013""; and (2) in subsection (c)(2) (b)(iv)(iv), by striking ""or 2011"" and inserting "", 2011, 2012, or 2013"".

13,2254,"section 1. short title. this act may be cited as the ""telework tax incentive act"". sec. 2. findings. the congress finds as follows: (1) federal, state, and local governments spend billions of dollars annually on the nation's transportation needs. (2) congestion on the nation's roads costs over $74,000,000,000 annually in lost work time, fuel consumption, and costs of infrastructure and equipment repair. (3) on average on-road-vehicles contribute 30 percent of nitrogen oxides emissions. (4) it is estimated that staying at home to work requires 3 times less energy consumption than commuting to work. (5) it was recently reported that if an identified 10 to 20 percent of commuters switched to teleworking, 1,800,000 tons of regulated pollutants would be eliminated, 3,500,000,000 gallons of gas would be saved, 3,100,000,000 hours of personal time would be freed up, and maintenance and infrastructure costs would decrease by $500,000,000 annually because of reduced congestion and reduced vehicle miles traveled. (6) the average american daily commute is 62 minutes for a 44-mile round-trip (a total of 6 days per year and 5,808 miles per year). (7) the increase in work from 1969 to 1996, the increase in hours mothers spend in paid work, combined with a shift toward single-parent families resulted in families on average experiencing a decrease of 22 hours a week (14 percent) in parental time available outside of paid work they could spend with their children. (8) companies with teleworking programs have found that teleworking can boost employee productivity 5 percent to 20 percent. (9) today 60 percent of the workforce is involved in information work (an increase of 43 percent since 1990) allowing and encouraging decentralization of paid work to occur. (10) in recent years, studies performed in the united states have shown a marked expansion of teleworking, with an estimate of 19,000,000 americans teleworking by the year 2002, 5 times the amount in 1990. sec. 3. credit for teleworking.

20,3200,"section 1. short title; findings. (a) short title. --this act may be cited as the ""rural equity payment index reform act of 2003"". (b) findings. --congress makes the following findings: (1) variations in the physician work adjustment factors under section 1848(e) of the social security act (42 u.s.c. 1395w-4w(e)) result in a physician work payment inequity between urban and rural localities under the medicare physician fee schedule. (2) the amount the medicare program spends on its beneficiaries varies substantially across the country, far more than can be accounted for by differences in the cost of living or differences in health status. (3) since beneficiaries and others pay into the program on the basis of income and wages and beneficiaries pay the same premium for part b services, these payments result in substantial cross-subsidies from people living in low payment states with conservative practice styles or beneficiary preferences to people living in higher payment states with aggressive practice styles or beneficiary preferences. (4) congress has been mindful of these variations when it comes to capitation payments made to managed care plans under the medicare+choice program and has put in place floors that increase monthly payments by more than one-third in some of the lowest payment counties over what would otherwise occur. but this change addresses only a very small fraction of medicare beneficiaries who are presently enrolled in medicare+choice plans operating in low payment counties. (5) unfortunately, congress has only begun to address the underlying problem of substantial geographic variations in fee- for-service spending under traditional medicare. (6) improvements in rural hospital payment systems under the medicare program help to reduce aggregate per capita payment variation as rural hospitals are in large part located in low payment counties. (7) many rural communities have great difficulty attracting and retaining physicians and other skilled health professionals. (8) targeted efforts to provide relief to rural doctors in low payment localities would further reduce variation by improving access to primary and tertiary services along with more equitable payment. (9) geographic adjustment factors in the medicare program's resource-based relative value scale unfairly suppress fee-for- service payments to rural providers. (10) actual costs are not presently being measured accurately and payments do not reflect the costs of providing care. (11) unless something is done about medicare payment in rural areas, as the baby boom cohort ages into medicare, the financial demands on rural communities to subsidize care for their aged and disabled medicare beneficiaries will progress from difficult to impossible in another 10 years. (12) the impact on rural health care infrastructure will be first felt in economically depressed rural areas where the ability to shift costs is already limited. sec. 2. physician fee schedule wage index revision. section 1848(e)(1) of the social security act (42 u.s.c. 1395w- 4(e)(1)) is amended-- (1) in subparagraph (a), by striking ""subparagraphs (b) and (c)"" and inserting ""subparagraphs (b), (c), and (e)""; and (2) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph: ""(e) floor for work geographic indices. -- "" (i) in general. --notwithstanding the work geographic index otherwise calculated under subparagraph (a) (iii), in no case may the work geographic index applied for payment under this section be less than-- "" (i) 0.976 for services furnished during 2004; "" (ii) 0.987 for services furnished during 2005; "" (iii) 0.995 for services furnished during 2006; and "" (iv) 1.000 for services furnished during 2007 and subsequent years.
