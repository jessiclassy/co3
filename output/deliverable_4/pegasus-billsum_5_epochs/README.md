#  Deliverable 4 Run Details

Each folder here represents a run/pipeline executed during deliverable 4. An abbreviated and long name of each is provided, followed by an explanation of each pipeline: 

| Pipeline Name        | Long Name     |
| -------------        | ------------- |
| wugwATSS-billsum     | pegasusbillsum-100simplified-evaluated-on-unsimplified/simplified-test |
| wugwATSS-led         | led-100simplified-evaluated-on-unsimplified-test            |
| wugNATSS-billsum     | pegasusbillsum-100chunked-evaluated-on-unsimplified-test    |
| wugNATSS-large       | pegasuslarge-100chunked-evaluated-on-unsimplified-test      |



{Model}\_{Clean}\_{Chunk}\_{Simplify}\_{Training Instance Count}


# Flag Options

{Model} = Model Name

pegasusbillsum : [Pegasus BillSum](https://huggingface.co/google/pegasus-billsum)

led : [longformer encoder decoder]()

---
{Clean} = Binary flag indicating whether to use clean or unclean billsum data. No flag means "unclean"/original data

clean : indicates whether billsum document text is "cleaned" (using regexes to remove Section headers and parentheses, etc)

---
{Chunk} = Method of chunking. Deterministic chunking or Se3 chunking

det : chunking of bill text into fixed size blocks

se3 : chunking of bill text based on semantic chunking (based on the Se3 framework) using a model tokenizer and LegalBERT

---
{Simplify} = Binary flag indicating whether to use simplified or "raw" billsum data.

simple : indicates whether a billsum document text was simplified by T5 split and rephrase model

---
{Training Instance Count} = Number of Training Instances used for fine-tuning

\# : The number of training instances ran

toy : means we ran 15 instances

---

If one of these flags is missing, it means the pipeline doesn't use any of the options for the flag as presented above.
